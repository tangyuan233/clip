> **摘要**:
>  文章讨论了一种名为“借助工具，留在网络”的策略，用于推动网络的快速发展。这一策略的核心在于先吸引用户使用某种单人工具，从而达到初步的用户规模，并随后引导他们参与网络互动，进而为用户创造长期价值，并增强公司的防御能力。文章提供了两个历史案例：*Delicious*，其单人工具是云书签服务，而多用户网络则是链接发现和共享的标签系统；另一个是*Instagram*，其最初的吸引点是创新的照片滤镜，后续发展出更强大的社交网络功能。尽管这种策略有效，但并非唯一的网络建设方式，一些成功的网络如Facebook和Twitter并没有使用单人工具，文章强调从零开始建立网络的困难，指出单人工具可以看作是火种，帮助点燃网络。

A popular strategy for bootstrapping networks is what I like to call “come for the tool, stay for the network.”

The idea is to initially attract users with a [single-player tool](http://cdixon.org/2010/06/12/designing-products-for-single-and-multiplayer-modes/) and then, over time, get them to participate in a network. The tool helps get to initial critical mass. The network creates the long term value for users, and defensibility for the company.

Here are two historical examples: 1) *Delicious*. The single-player tool was a cloud service for your bookmarks. The multiplayer network was a tagging system for discovering and sharing links. 2) *Instagram*. Instagram’s initial hook was the innovative photo filters. At the time some other apps like Hipstamatic had filters but you had to pay for them. Instagram also made it easy to share your photos on other networks like Facebook and Twitter. But you could also share on Instagram’s network, which of course became the preferred way to use Instagram over time.

The “come for the tool, stay for the network” strategy isn't the only way to build a network. Some networks never had single-player tools, including gigantic successes like Facebook and Twitter. But starting a network from scratch is very hard. Think of single-player tools as kindling.
