> **摘要**:
>  文章探讨了一种名为“来为工具，留为网络”的策略，用于启动网络。该策略首先通过单人工具吸引用户，并通过时间的推移促使用户参与网络，工具帮助达到初始的用户规模，而网络则为用户提供长期价值和企业的防御力。文章列举了两个历史案例：*Delicious*的云书签服务和*Instagram*的创新照片滤镜，二者均通过提供实用的单人工具吸引用户，随后逐渐形成活跃的用户网络。虽然此策略并非构建网络的唯一途径，但单人工具在网络起步阶段起到了重要的助推作用。

A popular strategy for bootstrapping networks is what I like to call “come for the tool, stay for the network.”

The idea is to initially attract users with a [single-player tool](http://cdixon.org/2010/06/12/designing-products-for-single-and-multiplayer-modes/) and then, over time, get them to participate in a network. The tool helps get to initial critical mass. The network creates the long term value for users, and defensibility for the company.

Here are two historical examples: 1) *Delicious*. The single-player tool was a cloud service for your bookmarks. The multiplayer network was a tagging system for discovering and sharing links. 2) *Instagram*. Instagram’s initial hook was the innovative photo filters. At the time some other apps like Hipstamatic had filters but you had to pay for them. Instagram also made it easy to share your photos on other networks like Facebook and Twitter. But you could also share on Instagram’s network, which of course became the preferred way to use Instagram over time.

The “come for the tool, stay for the network” strategy isn't the only way to build a network. Some networks never had single-player tools, including gigantic successes like Facebook and Twitter. But starting a network from scratch is very hard. Think of single-player tools as kindling.
