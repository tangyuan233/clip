July 2023  2023 年 7 月

If you collected lists of techniques for doing great work in a lot of different fields, what would the intersection look like? I decided to find out by making it.

  

如果你收集了大量不同领域中出色工作的技巧列表，它们的交集会是什么样子？我决定通过实践来找出答案。

Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone working in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the intersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does have a definite shape; it's not just a point labelled "work hard."

  

我的目标部分是创建一个可以由任何领域的工作者使用的指南。但我也对交叉点的形状感到好奇。这项练习表明，它确实有一个明确的形状；它不仅仅是一个标记为“努力工作”的点。

The following recipe assumes you're very ambitious.

  

该食谱假设你非常有抱负。

The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work.

  

第一步是决定要做什么。你选择的工作需要具备三个特点：它必须是你有天赋的，你对它有深厚的兴趣，并且能够提供做伟大工作的空间。

In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion. Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it. So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in.

\[[1](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f1n)\]  

实际上，你不必过多担心第三个标准。有抱负的人在这方面已经过于保守了。所以你只需要找到你既有天赋又感兴趣的事情。\[1\]

That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When you're young you don't know what you're good at or what different kinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not even exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at 14, most have to figure it out.

  

这听起来很简单，但通常相当困难。当你年轻的时候，你不知道自己擅长什么，也不知道各种工作的样子。你最终从事的工作可能甚至还不存在。所以虽然有些人 14 岁就知道自己想要做什么，但大多数人还得去摸索。

The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields.

  

找出要做什么的方法就是去做。如果你不确定要做什么，就猜一猜。但选一样东西开始行动。你可能会在某些时候猜错，但这没关系。了解多件事物是好事；一些最大的发现来自于注意到不同领域之间的联系。

Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let "work" mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your part of it.

  

培养自己项目的习惯。不要让“工作”意味着别人让你做的事情。如果你有一天真的做出了出色的作品，那可能是在你自己的项目上。它可能是在某个更大的项目中，但你会推动你自己的部分。

What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach yourself calculus, till at 21 you're starting to explore unanswered questions in physics. But always preserve excitingness.

  

你的项目应该是什么？对你来说看起来既令人兴奋又雄心勃勃的事情。随着你年龄的增长和项目品味的演变，令人兴奋和重要的事情会趋于一致。7 岁时，用乐高搭建巨大的东西可能看起来既令人兴奋又雄心勃勃，14 岁时自学微积分，到 21 岁时开始探索物理学中的未解之谜。但始终保持兴奋感。

There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on.

  

这种兴奋的好奇心既是伟大工作的引擎也是舵手。它不仅会推动你，如果你让它随心所欲，还会告诉你该做什么工作。

What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that would bore most other people? That's what you're looking for.

  

你在过度好奇什么——好奇到让大多数人感到厌烦的程度？那就是你在寻找的东西。

Once you've found something you're excessively interested in, the next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.

  

一旦你发现某件事物让你极度感兴趣，下一步就是学习足够多的知识，让你达到知识前沿。知识以分形的方式扩展，从远处看其边缘看起来很平滑，但一旦你学到足够多的知识接近它，你会发现其中充满了空白。

The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions about things that everyone else took for granted.

\[[2](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f2n)\]  

下一步是注意到它们。这需要一些技巧，因为你的大脑想要忽略这些缺口，以便构建一个更简单的世界模型。许多发现都来自于对他人视为理所当然的事情提出问题。\[2\]

If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often has a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math. It would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears, embrace it.

  

如果答案看起来很奇怪，那就更好了。伟大的工作往往带有一些奇怪的味道。从绘画到数学，你都能看到这一点。试图去制造它可能会受到影响，但如果它出现了，就拥抱它吧。

Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren't interested in them — in fact, especially if they aren't. If you're excited about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have enough expertise to say precisely what they're all overlooking, that's as good a bet as you'll find.

\[[3](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f3n)\]  

大胆追求边缘想法，即使其他人对此不感兴趣——事实上，尤其是如果他们不感兴趣。如果你对其他人忽视的可能性感到兴奋，并且你有足够的专长来准确指出他们所有人都在忽视的东西，那么这几乎是你能找到的最佳赌注。\[3\]

Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone who's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.

  

四个步骤：选择一个领域，学习足够多的知识以到达前沿，注意到差距，探索有希望的领域。这是几乎所有做出杰出工作的人所采取的方式，从画家到物理学家。

Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality. That's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could.

  

第二步和第四步需要付出努力。可能无法证明你必须努力工作才能做成大事，但经验证据的规模与死亡率的证据相当。这就是为什么专注于你深感兴趣的事情至关重要。兴趣将驱使你比单纯的勤奋更加努力。

The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all.

  

好奇心、快乐和想要做些令人印象深刻的事情是三种最强大的动机。有时它们会汇聚在一起，这种组合是最强大的。

The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there's a whole world inside.

  

大奖是发现一个新的分形芽。你注意到知识表面的裂缝，撬开它，里面有一个全新的世界。

Let's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring out what to work on. The main reason it's hard is that you can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it. And in the meantime you're not doing, and thus not learning about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose late based on very incomplete information.

\[[4](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f4n)\]  

让我们再谈谈确定要做什么的复杂商业。之所以困难，是因为除非亲自尝试，否则你无法了解大多数工作是什么样的。这意味着四个步骤是重叠的：你可能需要为某件事工作多年，才能知道你是否喜欢它，或者你是否擅长它。同时，你并没有在做，因此没有学习到大多数其他类型的工作。所以，在最坏的情况下，你会在非常不完整的信息基础上做出晚期的选择。\[4\]

The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do.

  

野心本质加剧了这个问题。野心有两种形式，一种先于对主题的兴趣，另一种则由此产生。大多数做出伟大工作的人都有所混合，而你越有前者，决定做什么就越困难。

The educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy. They expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what it's really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.

  

大多数国家的教育体系假装它很容易。他们期望你在真正了解之前就承诺一个领域。结果，一个有抱负的人在一个最佳轨迹上，往往会把系统视为一种故障的例子。

It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted that the system not only can't do much to help you figure out what to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you'll somehow magically guess as a teenager. They don't tell you, but I will: when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you're on your own. Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the assumption that everyone does.

  

他们至少应该承认这一点——如果他们承认这个系统不仅无法帮助你确定该做什么工作，而且是基于你作为一个青少年会神奇地猜到的假设来设计的。他们没有告诉你，但我会：在确定该做什么工作时，你必须自己解决。有些人运气好，猜对了，但其他人会发现自己在假设每个人都这么做的基础上，慌乱地跨越轨道。

What should you do if you're young and ambitious but don't know what to work on? What you should *not* do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions.

\[[5](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f5n)\]  

如果你年轻有抱负却不知道该做什么工作，你应该怎么做？你不应该被动地漂泊，认为问题会自己解决。你需要采取行动。但没有一个你可以遵循的系统程序。当你阅读那些完成伟大工作的名人的传记时，你会注意到运气在其中扮演了多么重要的角色。他们是通过偶然的相遇，或者通过阅读他们偶然拿起的书籍来发现他们要做什么的。所以你需要让自己成为运气的大靶子，而要做到这一点，就是要保持好奇心。尝试很多事情，遇见很多人，阅读很多书籍，提出很多问题。\[5\]

When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they're like. But a field should become *increasingly* interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you.

  

当不确定时，优化有趣性。随着你对领域的了解加深，领域也会发生变化。例如，数学家所做的工作与你高中数学课上的工作非常不同。因此，你需要给不同类型的工作机会，以了解它们的本质。但是，随着你对领域的了解加深，它应该变得越来越有趣。如果不这样，可能不适合你。

Don't worry if you find you're interested in different things than other people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you'll be productive. And you're more likely to find new things if you're looking where few have looked before.

  

不要担心，如果你发现自己对不同于他人的事物感兴趣。你对有趣事物的品味越奇特，就越好。奇特的味道通常很强烈，对工作的强烈兴趣意味着你会富有成效。而且，如果你在别人很少看过的地方寻找，你更有可能找到新事物。

One sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.

  

一个迹象表明你适合某种工作，那就是当你喜欢其他人觉得枯燥或可怕的部分。

But fields aren't people; you don't owe them any loyalty. If in the course of working on one thing you discover another that's more exciting, don't be afraid to switch.

  

但是领域不是人；你不必对他们有任何忠诚。如果在处理某件事的过程中你发现了另一件更令人兴奋的事情，不要害怕转换。

If you're making something for people, make sure it's something they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests, this will also get you your initial audience.

  

如果你为人们制作东西，确保它是他们真正想要的。最好的方法是制作你自己也想要的东西。写你想读的故事；构建你想使用的工具。由于你的朋友可能有相似的兴趣，这也会让你获得最初的观众。

This *should* follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong. Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down that route, you're lost.

\[[6](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f6n)\]  

这应该遵循激动人心规则。显然，最激动人心的故事将是你想读的那一个。我之所以明确提到这个案例，是因为这么多人做错了。他们不是按照自己的意愿去创作，而是试图去满足一些虚构的、更复杂的观众群体的需求。一旦你走上了这条路，你就会迷失方向。\[6\]

There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds. But if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof against all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray.

  

有很多力量会在你试图弄清楚要做什么时将你引入歧途。自负、时尚、恐惧、金钱、政治、他人的愿望、显赫的骗子。但如果你坚持你真正感兴趣的事情，你将能够抵御所有这些。如果你感兴趣，你就不会迷失方向。

Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy, but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it does take a good deal of boldness.

  

追随你的兴趣可能听起来像是一种相当被动的策略，但在实践中，它通常意味着要克服各种障碍去追随它们。你通常必须承担被拒绝和失败的风险。所以，这确实需要相当大的勇气。

But while you need boldness, you don't usually need much planning. In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants.

  

然而，虽然你需要勇气，但你通常不需要太多计划。在大多数情况下，做好工作的秘诀很简单：努力从事令人兴奋的宏伟项目，然后就会有所收获。与其制定计划然后执行，你只需尝试保持某些不变量。

The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements you can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal, but you can't discover natural selection that way.

  

计划的问题在于，它只适用于你可以提前描述的成就。你可以通过决定在孩提时代赢得金牌或致富，然后坚持不懈地追求那个目标，但你不能通过这种方式发现自然选择。

I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call this approach "staying upwind." This is how most people who've done great work seem to have done it.

  

我认为，对于大多数人来说，想要做出杰出工作的正确策略不是计划太多。在每个阶段，做任何看起来最有兴趣并且为你未来提供最佳选择的事情。我把这种做法称为“顺风而行”。这似乎是大多数做出杰出工作的人所采取的方式。

Even when you've found something exciting to work on, working on it is not always straightforward. There will be times when some new idea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to work. But there will also be plenty of times when things aren't like that.

  

即使你找到了令人兴奋的工作，但工作起来并不总是那么简单。有时，一些新想法会让你早上立刻跳下床，直接开始工作。但也会有 plenty of times when things aren't like that。

You don't just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration. There are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there's a technique to working, just as there is to sailing.

  

你不仅仅是扬帆起航，被灵感吹向前。有逆风、水流和隐藏的浅滩。所以工作也有技巧，就像航海一样。

For example, while you must work hard, it's possible to work too hard, and if you do that you'll find you get diminishing returns: fatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health. The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the type. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for four or five hours a day.

  

例如，虽然你必须努力工作，但过度工作也是可能的，如果你这样做，你会发现你得到的回报越来越少：疲劳会使你变笨，最终甚至损害你的健康。工作产生递减回报的点取决于类型。你可能只能每天工作四到五小时的一些最困难类型。

Ideally those hours will be contiguous. To the extent you can, try to arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in. You'll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted.

  

理想情况下，这些小时应该是连续的。尽可能安排你的生活，以便你有大块的时间来工作。如果你知道可能会被打断，你会回避困难的工作。

It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working. You'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial threshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a flaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both per day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the sense that it's higher than the energy required to keep going, it's ok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over it.

  

可能开始工作比继续工作更难。你经常需要欺骗自己来跨越那个初始门槛。不用担心这个问题；这是工作的本质，而不是你性格上的缺陷。工作有一种激活能量，无论是每天还是每个项目。由于这个门槛在某种程度上是虚假的，因为它高于继续所需的能量，所以告诉自己相应程度的谎言来克服它是可以的。

It's usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great work, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn't. When I'm reluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by saying "I'll just read over what I've got so far." Five minutes later I've found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and I'm off.

  

通常，如果你想做出伟大的工作，对自己撒谎是个错误，但这是少数几个不是这种情况的例子之一。当我早上不愿意开始工作时，我经常通过告诉自己“我只是浏览一下到目前为止的内容”来欺骗自己。五分钟后，我发现了一些似乎有误或不完整的地方，然后我就开始了。

Similar techniques work for starting new projects. It's ok to lie to yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example. Lots of great things began with someone saying "How hard could it be?"

  

类似的技术适用于启动新项目。对自己说一个项目将需要多少工作量是可以的，例如。许多伟大的事情都是从有人说“这能有多难？”开始的。

This is one case where the young have an advantage. They're more optimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism is ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.

  

这是年轻人有优势的一个例子。他们更加乐观，尽管他们乐观的一个来源是无知，但在这种情况下，无知有时能战胜知识。

Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.

  

尽量完成你开始的事情，即使结果比你预期的要更多工作。完成事情不仅仅是整洁或自律的练习。在许多项目中，很多最好的工作发生在原本应该是最终阶段的时候。

Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what you're working on, at least in your own mind. If that helps you discover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after all.

\[[7](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f7n)\]  

另一种可接受的谎言是夸大你所从事工作的意义，至少在你自己的心中是这样。如果这能帮助你发现新事物，那么最终可能发现这根本就不是谎言。\[7\]

Since there are two senses of starting work — per day and per project — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project procrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't quite right. When you're procrastinating in units of years, you can get a lot not done.

\[[8](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f8n)\]  

由于开始工作有两种含义——按日和按项目——因此也有两种拖延形式。按项目拖延远比按日拖延危险。你因为时机不太合适，将那个雄心勃勃的项目推迟了又推迟，从一年到下一年。当你以年为单位拖延时，你会有很多事情没有完成。\[8\]

One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it usually camouflages itself as work. You're not just sitting around doing nothing; you're working industriously on something else. So per-project procrastination doesn't set off the alarms that per-day procrastination does. You're too busy to notice it.

  

每个项目的拖延症之所以如此危险，是因为它通常伪装成工作。你不是在无所事事地坐着；你正在勤奋地做其他事情。因此，每个项目的拖延症不会像每天拖延那样触发警报。你太忙了，以至于没有注意到它。

The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on what I most want to work on? When you're young it's ok if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous as you get older.

\[[9](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f9n)\]  

打败它的方法是偶尔停下来问问自己：我正在做我最想做的事情吗？当你年轻的时候，如果答案是偶尔不是，那还可以接受，但随着年龄的增长，这变得越来越危险。\[9\]

Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can't think of this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the work sufficiently engaging as it's happening.

  

优秀的作品通常意味着在大多数人看来不合理的时间上投入到一个问题上。你不能将这段时间视为成本，否则它看起来会过高。你必须找到在发生时的这项工作足够吸引人。

There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not how great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you're genuinely interested in. When you pause to take stock, you're surprised how far you've come.

  

可能有些工作需要你在不喜欢的事情上勤奋工作多年，才能到达美好的部分，但这并不是伟大工作的发生方式。伟大工作是通过持续关注你真正感兴趣的事情来实现的。当你停下来审视时，你会惊讶于你已经走了多远。

The reason we're surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but if you do it every day you'll write a book a year. That's the key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.

  

我们之所以感到惊讶，是因为我们低估了工作的累积效应。每天写一页听起来不多，但如果每天都这样做，你一年就能写一本书。关键在于：一致性。那些做出伟大事业的人并不是每天都能完成很多事情。他们至少完成了一些事情，而不是什么都不做。

If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most people who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon: the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more. Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more new fans they'll bring you.

  

如果你从事的是复合型工作，你会获得指数级增长。大多数从事这项工作的人都是无意识的，但停下来思考一下是值得的。例如，学习就是这种现象的一个例子：你对某件事了解得越多，学习更多就越容易。扩大听众群体也是一样：你拥有的粉丝越多，他们为你带来的新粉丝就越多。

The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning. It isn't; it's still a wonderful exponential curve. But we can't grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential growth in its early stages.

  

指数增长的麻烦在于，一开始曲线看起来很平坦。其实不是；它仍然是一条美好的指数曲线。但我们无法直观地理解这一点，所以在早期阶段我们低估了指数增长。

Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it's worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since we underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase of learning something new because they know from experience that learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do. If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential growth, many more would do it.

  

某事物呈指数增长，其价值可能变得极高，以至于值得付出非凡的努力去启动它。但由于我们在一开始就低估了指数增长，这也大多是在无意识中完成的：人们会克服学习新事物初期的无回报阶段，因为他们从经验中知道，学习新事物总是需要一开始的推动，或者他们一个粉丝一个粉丝地扩大听众，因为他们没有更好的事情可做。如果人们有意识地意识到他们可以投资于指数增长，那么会有更多的人这样做。

Work doesn't just happen when you're trying to. There's a kind of undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a little, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack.

  

工作并非只是在你努力时才会发生。当你散步、洗澡或躺在床上时，你会进行一种无目的的思考，这种思考可能非常强大。通过让你的思绪稍微飘散，你通常会解决那些你无法通过正面攻击解决的问题。

You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this phenomenon, though. You can't just walk around daydreaming. The daydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feeds it questions.

\[[10](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f10n)\]  

你必须以正常方式努力工作才能从这种现象中受益，你不能只是整天幻想。幻想必须与提出问题的有意识工作交织在一起。\[10\]

Everyone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it's also important to avoid them in the other half of the cycle. When you let your mind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that moment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out of the top spot, or you'll waste this valuable type of thinking on the distraction instead. (Exception: Don't avoid love.)

  

每个人都知道在工作时避免分心很重要，但同样重要的是在周期的另一半也要避免。当你让思绪飘散时，它会飘向那一刻你最关心的事情。所以避免那种将你的工作推到次要位置的分心，否则你会在分心上浪费这种宝贵类型的思考。（例外：不要避免爱情。）

Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't know what you're aiming for.

  

有意识地培养你在自己领域内工作的品味。直到你知道什么是最好的以及为什么它是最好的，你都不知道你究竟在追求什么。

And that *is* what you're aiming for, because if you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good. This observation has been made by so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth thinking about why it's true. It could be because ambition is a phenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — where almost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short. Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively different thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good is simply too vague a standard. Probably all three are true.

\[[11](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f11n)\]  

这就是你追求的目标，因为如果你不努力成为最好的，你甚至都不会做得好。这么多人从这么多不同的领域提出了这个观察，这可能值得思考为什么它是真的。这可能是因为野心是一种几乎所有的错误都朝一个方向的现象——几乎所有的壳都没有击中目标，都是因为不足。或者可能是因为成为最好的野心与成为好的野心在本质上不同。或者也许好是一个过于模糊的标准。可能三者都是真的。\[11\]

Fortunately there's a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might seem like you'd be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be the best, in practice you often end up net ahead. It's exciting, and also strangely liberating. It simplifies things. In some ways it's easier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good.

  

幸运的是，这里有一种规模经济的现象。虽然尝试做到最好可能会让你承担沉重的负担，但实际上你通常能获得净收益。这令人兴奋，也出奇地令人解脱。它简化了事情。在某些方面，努力做到最好比仅仅做到好要容易。

One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will care about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter more than your contemporaries', but because something that still seems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good.

  

一种设定高目标的方法是尝试创造出一百年后人们仍会关心的事物。不是因为他们的观点比你的同龄人更重要，而是因为一百年后仍看起来不错的事物更有可能真正是好的。

Don't try to work in a distinctive style. Just try to do the best job you can; you won't be able to help doing it in a distinctive way.

  

不要试图以独特风格工作。只需尽力做好你的工作；你无法避免以独特的方式完成它。

Style is doing things in a distinctive way without trying to. Trying to is affectation.

  

风格是做事有特色而不刻意为之。刻意为之是做作。

Affectation is in effect to pretend that someone other than you is doing the work. You adopt an impressive but fake persona, and while you're pleased with the impressiveness, the fakeness is what shows in the work.

\[[12](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f12n)\]  

分配就是假装别人在做这项工作。你扮演一个令人印象深刻但虚假的角色，虽然你对这种印象深刻感到满意，但虚假性正是体现在工作中。\[12\]

The temptation to be someone else is greatest for the young. They often feel like nobodies. But you never need to worry about that problem, because it's self-solving if you work on sufficiently ambitious projects. If you succeed at an ambitious project, you're not a nobody; you're the person who did it. So just do the work and your identity will take care of itself.

  

年轻人最容易受到成为他人的诱惑。他们常常觉得自己是无关紧要的人。但你永远不必担心这个问题，因为如果你致力于足够雄心勃勃的项目，它就会自我解决。如果你在一个雄心勃勃的项目中取得成功，你就不是无关紧要的人；你是完成它的人。所以，只管去做工作，你的身份自然会得到照顾。

"Avoid affectation" is a useful rule so far as it goes, but how would you express this idea positively? How would you say what to be, instead of what not to be? The best answer is earnest. If you're earnest you avoid not just affectation but a whole set of similar vices.

  

避免做作是一条有用的规则，但如何以积极的方式表达这个想法？你该如何表达“要成为什么”，而不是“不要成为什么”？最好的答案是真诚。如果你真诚，你不仅会避免做作，还会避免一系列类似的恶习。

The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We're taught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue — as a kind of sacrifice. But in fact it's a source of power too. To see new ideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You're trying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can you have a sharp eye for the truth if you're intellectually dishonest?

  

真诚的核心是智力上的诚实。我们从小就被告知诚实是一种无私的美德——一种牺牲。但实际上，它也是一种力量。要看到新思想，你需要对真相有异常敏锐的洞察力。你试图看到比其他人更早看到的真相。那么，如果你在智力上不诚实，你怎么能对真相有敏锐的洞察力呢？

One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight positive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing to admit that you're mistaken. Once you've admitted you were mistaken about something, you're free. Till then you have to carry it.

\[[13](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f13n)\]  

一种避免智力不诚实的方法是在相反方向上保持轻微的正压力。要积极地愿意承认你错了。一旦你承认你在某件事上犯了错误，你就自由了。在此之前，你必须承担它。\[13\]

Another more subtle component of earnestness is informality. Informality is much more important than its grammatically negative name implies. It's not merely the absence of something. It means focusing on what matters instead of what doesn't.

  

诚挚性的另一个更微妙的组成部分是不正式。不正式比其语法上的负面名称所暗示的更为重要。它不仅仅是某物的缺失。这意味着关注重要的事情，而不是不重要的事情。

What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as doing the work, you're trying to seem a certain way as you're doing it. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being good. That's one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work: they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that's basically the definition of a nerd.

  

形式和做作共有的特点在于，你在做事情的同时，也在努力表现出某种特定的样子。但任何投入到如何表现上的精力，都会从做得好中流失。这就是为什么书呆子在出色的工作中具有优势的原因之一：他们在如何表现上投入很少的努力。事实上，这基本上就是书呆子的定义。

Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that's exactly what you need in doing great work. It's not learned; it's preserved from childhood. So hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than the one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticisms of them. "It's easy to criticize" is true in the most literal sense, and the route to great work is never easy.

  

书呆子们有一种天真的勇气，这正是你做伟大工作时所需要的。这不是学来的，而是从童年时期保留下来的。所以，请珍惜它。成为那个敢于提出观点的人，而不是那个坐下来对他们提出听起来很复杂的批评的人。“批评很容易”在字面上是正确的，通往伟大工作的道路永远不会容易。

There may be some jobs where it's an advantage to be cynical and pessimistic, but if you want to do great work it's an advantage to be optimistic, even though that means you'll risk looking like a fool sometimes. There's an old tradition of doing the opposite. The Old Testament says it's better to keep quiet lest you look like a fool. But that's advice for *seeming* smart. If you actually want to discover new things, it's better to take the risk of telling people your ideas.

  

有些工作可能对悲观和愤世嫉俗的人来说是一种优势，但如果你想做出伟大的工作，乐观是一种优势，即使这意味着你有时会显得像个傻瓜。有一种古老的传统是做相反的事情。《旧约》说，保持沉默比显得像个傻瓜要好。但这是一种显得聪明的建议。如果你实际上想发现新事物，那么告诉人们你的想法的风险更好。

Some people are naturally earnest, and with others it takes a conscious effort. Either kind of earnestness will suffice. But I doubt it would be possible to do great work without being earnest. It's so hard to do even if you are. You don't have enough margin for error to accommodate the distortions introduced by being affected, intellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool.

\[[14](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f14n)\]  

有些人天生认真，而有些人则需要付出有意识的努力。任何一种认真程度都足够。但我怀疑如果不认真，是不可能做出伟大工作的。即使你很认真，这也非常困难。你无法为因受影响、智力不诚实、正统、时尚或酷而引入的扭曲留出足够的错误空间。\[14\]

Great work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself. It's usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle of working on something, ask which choice is more consistent.

  

伟大的工作不仅与其创作者一致，而且与其自身一致。它通常是完整的。所以，如果你在处理某事的过程中面临一个决定，问问哪个选择更一致。

You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won't necessarily have to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some effort; when there's something you need to redo, status quo bias and laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat this ask: If I'd already made the change, would I want to revert to what I have now?

  

你可能需要扔掉某些东西并重新做。你不必一定这么做，但你必须愿意这么做。这需要一些努力；当你需要重新做某事时，现状偏见和懒惰会结合在一起，让你对此予以否认。为了克服这一点，问问自己：如果我已经做出了改变，我会想要回到现在这个样子吗？

Have the confidence to cut. Don't keep something that doesn't fit just because you're proud of it, or because it cost you a lot of effort.

  

有勇气去割舍。不要因为自豪或因为付出了很多努力就保留那些不适合的东西。

Indeed, in some kinds of work it's good to strip whatever you're doing to its essence. The result will be more concentrated; you'll understand it better; and you won't be able to lie to yourself about whether there's anything real there.

  

确实，在某些工作中，将你所做的事情简化到其本质是好的。结果将更加集中；你会更好地理解它；而且你不会欺骗自己关于那里是否有真实的东西。

Mathematical elegance may sound like a mere metaphor, drawn from the arts. That's what I thought when I first heard the term "elegant" applied to a proof. But now I suspect it's conceptually prior — that the main ingredient in artistic elegance is mathematical elegance. At any rate it's a useful standard well beyond math.

  

数学的优雅可能听起来像是一个仅仅从艺术中借用的比喻。这就是我第一次听到“优雅”这个词被用来形容一个证明时的想法。但现在我怀疑它是在概念上先于艺术的——艺术优雅的主要成分是数学的优雅。无论如何，它是一个超越数学的有用标准。

Elegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions will often have more prestige in the short term. They cost a lot of effort and they're hard to understand, both of which impress people, at least temporarily.

  

优雅可能是一种长期的投资，尽管如此。在短期内，费力的解决方案通常会有更多的声望。它们需要大量的努力，而且难以理解，这两者都会给人留下深刻印象，至少是暂时的。

Whereas some of the very best work will seem like it took comparatively little effort, because it was in a sense already there. It didn't have to be built, just seen. It's a very good sign when it's hard to say whether you're creating something or discovering it.

  

然而，一些非常出色的作品似乎只需相对较少的努力，因为从某种意义上说，它们已经存在。它们不需要被建造，只需要被看到。当很难说你是创造还是发现某物时，这是一个非常好的迹象。

When you're doing work that could be seen as either creation or discovery, err on the side of discovery. Try thinking of yourself as a mere conduit through which the ideas take their natural shape.

  

当你从事可能被视为创造或发现的工作时，偏向于选择发现。试着把自己看作是一个仅仅作为思想自然成形的管道。

(Strangely enough, one exception is the problem of choosing a problem to work on. This is usually seen as search, but in the best case it's more like creating something. In the best case you create the field in the process of exploring it.)

  

奇怪的是，一个例外是选择要解决的问题。这通常被视为搜索，但在最佳情况下，它更像是一种创造。在最佳情况下，你在探索的过程中创造了这个领域。

Similarly, if you're trying to build a powerful tool, make it gratuitously unrestrictive. A powerful tool almost by definition will be used in ways you didn't expect, so err on the side of eliminating restrictions, even if you don't know what the benefit will be.

  

同样，如果你正在尝试构建一个强大的工具，让它无限制。一个强大的工具几乎按定义将会以你未预料到的方式被使用，所以即使你不知道将带来什么好处，也要偏向于消除限制。

Great work will often be tool-like in the sense of being something others build on. So it's a good sign if you're creating ideas that others could use, or exposing questions that others could answer. The best ideas have implications in many different areas.

  

优秀的作品往往具有工具性，意味着它是他人可以在此基础上构建的。所以，如果你创造的想法可以被他人使用，或者提出的问题可以被他人解答，那是一个好兆头。最好的想法在许多不同的领域都有影响。

If you express your ideas in the most general form, they'll be truer than you intended.

  

如果你以最一般的形式表达你的想法，它们将比你预期的更真实。

True by itself is not enough, of course. Great ideas have to be true and new. And it takes a certain amount of ability to see new ideas even once you've learned enough to get to one of the frontiers of knowledge.

  

当然，仅仅真实是不够的。伟大的想法必须既真实又新颖。即使你已经学到了足够多的知识，能够达到知识前沿，也需要一定的能力才能看到新的想法。

In English we give this ability names like originality, creativity, and imagination. And it seems reasonable to give it a separate name, because it does seem to some extent a separate skill. It's possible to have a great deal of ability in other respects — to have a great deal of what's often called *technical* ability — and yet not have much of this.

  

在英语中，我们给这种能力起名如独创性、创造力和想象力。给它一个单独的名字似乎是合理的，因为它似乎在一定程度上是一种不同的技能。可能在其他方面有很大的能力——拥有大量的通常所说的技术能力——然而却不太具备这种能力。

I've never liked the term "creative process." It seems misleading. Originality isn't a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers throw off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle grinder throwing off sparks. They can't help it.

  

我从不喜欢“创意过程”这个术语。这似乎具有误导性。原创性不是一种过程，而是一种思维习惯。原创性思想家会就他们关注的任何事物抛出新想法，就像角磨机抛出火花一样。他们无法控制自己。

If the thing they're focused on is something they don't understand very well, these new ideas might not be good. One of the most original thinkers I know decided to focus on dating after he got divorced. He knew roughly as much about dating as the average 15 year old, and the results were spectacularly colorful. But to see originality separated from expertise like that made its nature all the more clear.

  

如果他们关注的事情是他们不太了解的，这些新想法可能并不好。我所知道的最有创意的思想家之一在离婚后决定专注于约会。他对约会的了解和平均 15 岁的青少年差不多，结果非常丰富多彩。但看到这样的原创性被从专业知识中分离出来，它的本质就更加清晰了。

I don't know if it's possible to cultivate originality, but there are definitely ways to make the most of however much you have. For example, you're much more likely to have original ideas when you're working on something. Original ideas don't come from trying to have original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something slightly too difficult.

\[[15](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f15n)\]  

我不知道是否有可能培养独创性，但肯定有方法充分利用你所拥有的。例如，当你专注于某事时，你更有可能产生原创想法。原创想法不是来自试图拥有原创想法，而是来自试图构建或理解稍微有点困难的东西。\[15\]

Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good way to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a missing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you. Indeed, there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.

  

谈论或写作你感兴趣的事情是产生新想法的好方法。当你试图用言语表达想法时，一个缺失的想法会创造一种真空，将之从你身上吸出。确实，有一种思考只能通过写作来完成。

Changing your context can help. If you visit a new place, you'll often find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often dislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit. Sometimes it's enough just to go for a walk.

\[[16](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f16n)\]  

改变你的环境可能会有所帮助。如果你去一个新的地方，你通常会发现自己在那里有新的想法。旅行本身往往能激发这些想法。但你不一定非得走得很远才能得到这种好处。有时候，仅仅散步就足够了。\[16\]

It also helps to travel in topic space. You'll have more new ideas if you explore lots of different topics, partly because it gives the angle grinder more surface area to work on, and partly because analogies are an especially fruitful source of new ideas.

  

它还有助于在主题空间中旅行。如果你探索很多不同的主题，你会产生更多的新想法，部分原因是因为它给角磨机提供了更多的表面面积来工作，部分原因是因为类比是产生新想法的一个特别丰富的来源。

Don't divide your attention *evenly* between many topics though, or you'll spread yourself too thin. You want to distribute it according to something more like a power law.

\[[17](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f17n)\] Be professionally curious about a few topics and idly curious about many more.  

不要将注意力平均分配给许多主题，否则你会过于分散精力。你应根据某种更类似于幂律的东西来分配它。\[17\]对少数主题保持专业的好奇心，对更多主题保持闲散的好奇心。

Curiosity and originality are closely related. Curiosity feeds originality by giving it new things to work on. But the relationship is closer than that. Curiosity is itself a kind of originality; it's roughly to questions what originality is to answers. And since questions at their best are a big component of answers, curiosity at its best is a creative force.

  

好奇心和独创性密切相关。好奇心通过提供新事物来激发独创性。但关系比这更紧密。好奇心本身就是一种独创性；它对问题而言，就像独创性对答案一样。而且，在最佳状态下，问题是答案的重要组成部分，因此，在最佳状态下，好奇心是一种创造力。

Having new ideas is a strange game, because it usually consists of seeing things that were right under your nose. Once you've seen a new idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this before?

  

拥有新想法是一种奇怪的游戏，因为它通常包括看到那些就在你鼻子底下的事物。一旦你看到了一个新想法，它往往会显得很显然。为什么以前没有人想到这个呢？

When an idea seems simultaneously novel and obvious, it's probably a good one.

  

当一个想法同时显得新颖又明显时，它可能是一个好主意。

Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having new ideas is hard. What's the source of this apparent contradiction? It's that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the way you look at the world. We see the world through models that both help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas become obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard. That's how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover: they're easy to see after you do something hard.

  

看到明显的事物听起来很容易。然而，从经验上看，有新想法却很困难。这种明显矛盾的根源是什么？那就是看到新想法通常需要你改变看待世界的方式。我们通过既帮助我们又限制我们的模型来看待世界。当你修复一个破损的模型时，新想法就变得明显了。但注意到并修复一个破损的模型是困难的。这就是为什么新想法既明显又难以发现：在你做了困难的事情之后，它们才容易看到。

One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other people. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where they bash against reality. Most people don't want to see these clues. It would be an understatement to say that they're attached to their current model; it's what they think in; so they'll tend to ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuous it may seem in retrospect.

  

一种发现模型错误的方法是比其他人更严格。世界上的错误模型在与现实碰撞时留下了一串线索。大多数人不想看到这些线索。说他们对其当前模型有感情是一种轻描淡写；这是他们的思维方式；因此，他们往往会忽视其破裂留下的线索，尽管在事后看来可能非常明显。

To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead of looking away. That's what Einstein did. He was able to see the wild implications of Maxwell's equations not so much because he was looking for new ideas as because he was stricter.

  

要找到新想法，你必须抓住破裂的迹象，而不是回避。这正是爱因斯坦所做的事情。他之所以能够看到麦克斯韦方程的狂野含义，并不是因为他寻找新想法，而是因为他更加严谨。

The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical as it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps to be the sort of person who's comfortable breaking rules. From the point of view of the old model, which everyone including you initially shares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules.

  

其他你需要的是愿意打破规则。听起来可能有些矛盾，但如果你想修复你对世界的模型，成为一个愿意打破规则的人是有帮助的。从旧模型的角度来看，这是包括你在内的每个人最初都共享的，新模型通常至少打破了隐含的规则。

Few understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because new ideas seem much more conservative once they succeed. They seem perfectly reasonable once you're using the new model of the world they brought with them. But they didn't at the time; it took the greater part of a century for the heliocentric model to be generally accepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so wrong.

  

很少有人理解需要打破多少规则，因为一旦新想法成功，它们似乎就变得非常保守。一旦你开始使用它们带来的新世界观，它们看起来就非常合理。但当时并不是这样；地心说模型被普遍接受，甚至在天文学家中间，也花了大部分一个世纪的时间，因为它感觉是如此错误。

Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to most people, or someone would have already explored it. So what you're looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of crazy. How do you recognize these? You can't with certainty. Often ideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind of crazy tend to be exciting; they're rich in implications; whereas ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.

  

确实，如果你这么想，一个好的新想法在大多数人看来必须很糟糕，否则早就有人探索过了。所以你寻找的是看似疯狂，但却是正确类型的疯狂的想法。你如何识别这些想法？你不能确定。通常看似糟糕的想法确实是糟糕的。但正确类型的疯狂想法往往令人兴奋；它们充满含义；而仅仅是糟糕的想法往往令人沮丧。

There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy breaking them, and to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases being aggressively and passively independent-minded.

  

有两种方式可以舒适地打破规则：一种是享受打破规则，另一种是对规则漠不关心。我把这两种情况称为积极和消极的独立思考。

The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules don't merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional energy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity of a project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it started.

  

具有强烈独立思想的那些人是淘气的。规则并不能阻止他们；违反规则反而给他们带来额外的能量。对于这类人来说，对项目纯粹大胆的喜悦有时足以提供足够的激活能量来启动它。

The other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhaps even to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often make new discoveries; their ignorance of a field's assumptions acts as a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness. Aspies also seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs. Several I know say that this helps them to have new ideas.

  

另一种打破规则的方式是不在乎它们，或者甚至不知道它们的存在。这就是为什么新手和外行人经常会有新发现；他们对一个领域的假设的无知充当了一种暂时的被动独立思维来源。自闭症人士似乎也对传统信念具有免疫力。我所认识的几位都说这有助于他们产生新想法。

Strictness plus rule-breaking sounds like a strange combination. In popular culture they're opposed. But popular culture has a broken model in this respect. It implicitly assumes that issues are trivial ones, and in trivial matters strictness and rule-breaking *are* opposed. But in questions that really matter, only rule-breakers can be truly strict.

  

严谨与违规听起来像是一种奇怪的组合。在流行文化中，它们是对立的。但在这个方面，流行文化有一个错误的模式。它隐含地假设问题都是琐碎的，在琐碎的事情上，严谨与违规是对立的。但在真正重要的问题上，只有违规者才能真正做到严谨。

An overlooked idea often doesn't lose till the semifinals. You do see it, subconsciously, but then another part of your subconscious shoots it down because it would be too weird, too risky, too much work, too controversial. This suggests an exciting possibility: if you could turn off such filters, you could see more new ideas.

  

一个被忽视的想法通常不会在半决赛之前失败。你会在潜意识里看到它，但随后你潜意识中的另一部分会将其否定，因为它太奇怪、太冒险、太费劲、太有争议。这暗示了一个令人兴奋的可能性：如果你能关闭这样的过滤器，你就能看到更多的新想法。

One way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for *someone else* to explore. Then your subconscious won't shoot them down to protect you.

  

一种方法是问自己，对别人来说哪些想法是好的探索方向。然后你的潜意识就不会为了保护你而将它们否定。

You could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the other direction: by starting from what's obscuring them. Every cherished but mistaken principle is surrounded by a dead zone of valuable ideas that are unexplored because they contradict it.

  

你也可以通过从相反方向工作来发现被忽视的想法：从那些掩盖它们的东西开始。每个被珍视但错误的原理都围绕着一片死区，那里有价值但未被探索的想法，因为它们与之相矛盾。

Religions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles. So anything that can be described either literally or metaphorically as a religion will have valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow. Copernicus and Darwin both made discoveries of this type.

\[[18](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f18n)\]  

宗教是珍视但错误的原理集合。所以任何可以直译或隐喻地描述为宗教的事物，在其阴影下都蕴含着有价值的未探索思想。哥白尼和达尔文都做出了这类发现。\[18\]

What are people in your field religious about, in the sense of being too attached to some principle that might not be as self-evident as they think? What becomes possible if you discard it?

  

人们在你所在的领域对什么宗教般地执着，即过分依恋某些可能并不像他们想象中那么不言而喻的原则？如果你摒弃它，会变得可能？

People show much more originality in solving problems than in deciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly conservative when deciding what to work on. People who'd never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable problems.

  

人们解决问题时的独创性远高于决定要解决哪些问题。即使是聪明人，在决定要做什么工作时也可能出奇地保守。那些在其他方面从未想过要追求时尚的人也会被吸引去研究时尚问题。

One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than solutions is that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupy you for years, while exploring a solution might only take days. But even so I think most people are too conservative. They're not merely responding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problems are undervalued.

  

人们选择问题比选择解决方案更保守的一个原因是问题是大赌注。一个问题可能占据你数年，而探索一个解决方案可能只需几天。但即便如此，我认为大多数人还是过于保守。他们不仅是在应对风险，也是在应对潮流。不时髦的问题被低估了。

One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the problem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn't. Great work often takes something that already exists and shows its latent potential. Durer and Watt both did this. So if you're interested in a field that others think is tapped out, don't let their skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this.

  

最有趣的非时尚问题之一是人们认为已经被充分探索，但实际上并没有的问题。伟大的工作往往需要将已经存在的事物展现其潜在潜力。丢勒和瓦特都做到了这一点。所以如果你对别人认为已经枯竭的领域感兴趣，不要让他们怀疑你。人们在这方面往往都是错的。

Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There's no hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied elsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity. And there's a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas that would otherwise be wasted.

  

致力于一个不时髦的问题可以非常令人愉悦。没有炒作或匆忙。投机者和批评家都在别处忙碌。现有工作往往具有老派的坚实性。而且，培养那些本会被浪费的想法，有一种令人满意的节约感。

But the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly unfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn't seem to matter as much as it actually does. How do you find these? By being self-indulgent — by letting your curiosity have its way, and tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your head that says you should only be working on "important" problems.

  

但是最常见的被忽视的问题并不是在时尚意义上的过时。它只是似乎没有实际那么重要。你是如何找到这些问题的？通过自我放纵——让你的好奇心占上风，至少暂时忽略掉你头脑中那个告诉你应该只专注于“重要”问题的声音。

You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is too conservative about what counts as one. And if there's an important but overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it's probably already on your subconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if you were going to take a break from "serious" work to work on something just because it would be really interesting, what would you do? The answer is probably more important than it seems.

  

你需要解决重要问题，但几乎每个人都过于保守地看待什么是重要问题。而且，如果你社区里有一个重要但被忽视的问题，它可能已经在你的潜意识雷达屏幕上了。所以试着问自己：如果你要从“严肃”的工作中休息一下，去研究一些真正有趣的事情，你会做什么？答案可能比你想象的更重要。

Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than originality in solving them. That's what distinguishes the people who discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely the initial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the key to the whole game.

  

选择问题的原创性似乎比解决问题的原创性更重要。这就是区分发现全新领域的人的关键所在。因此，看似仅仅是第一步——决定做什么工作——在某种程度上是整个游戏的关键。

Few grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas is about the ratio of question to answer in their composition. People think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was in the question.

  

很少有人理解这一点。关于新想法的最大误解之一是它们构成中问题与答案的比例。人们认为大想法是答案，但往往真正的洞见在于问题本身。

Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they're used in schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before being answered, like unstable particles. But a really good question can be much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery. How do new species arise? Is the force that makes objects fall to earth the same as the one that keeps planets in their orbits? By even asking such questions you were already in excitingly novel territory.

  

我们低估问题的部分原因在于学校中它们的使用方式。在学校里，它们往往在回答之前就短暂存在，就像不稳定粒子一样。但一个好问题可以远不止于此。一个好问题是部分发现。新物种是如何出现的？使物体落向地球的力是否与保持行星在轨道上的力相同？仅仅提出这样的问题，你就已经进入了令人兴奋的新领域。

Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around with you. But the more you're carrying, the greater the chance of noticing a solution — or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing that two unanswered questions are the same.

  

未解答的问题可能是不舒服的事情，随身携带。但携带的越多，注意到解决方案的机会就越大——或者甚至更令人兴奋的是，注意到两个未解答的问题是相同的。

Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before — in your childhood, even — and couldn't stop thinking about. People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful dreams alive, but it's just as important to keep your youthful questions alive.

\[[19](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f19n)\]  

有时一个问题会困扰你很长时间。伟大的作品往往来自于回到多年前你第一次注意到的问题——甚至在你童年时期——并且无法停止思考。人们经常谈论保持年轻梦想的重要性，但保持年轻的问题同样重要。\[19\]

This is one of the places where actual expertise differs most from the popular picture of it. In the popular picture, experts are certain. But actually the more puzzled you are, the better, so long as (a) the things you're puzzled about matter, and (b) no one else understands them either.

  

这是实际专业知识与人们对它的普遍印象差异最大的地方之一。在普遍印象中，专家们是确定的。但实际上，你越困惑，越好，只要（a）你困惑的事情很重要，并且（b）其他人也不理解它们。

Think about what's happening at the moment just before a new idea is discovered. Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled about something. Which means that originality consists partly of puzzlement — of confusion! You have to be comfortable enough with the world being full of puzzles that you're willing to see them, but not so comfortable that you don't want to solve them.

\[[20](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f20n)\]  

思考一下在发现新想法之前的那一刻正在发生的事情。通常，某个具有足够专业知识的人会对某事感到困惑。这意味着原创性部分在于困惑——混乱！你必须足够舒适地认为这个世界充满了谜题，以至于你愿意去发现它们，但又不能太舒适以至于不愿意去解决它们。\[20\]

It's a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. And this is one of those situations where the rich get richer, because the best way to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones. Questions don't just lead to answers, but also to more questions.

  

富有未解答的问题是一种伟大的事情。这正是那些富有的人变得更富有的情况之一，因为获取新问题的最佳方式就是尝试回答现有的问题。问题不仅引导到答案，还引导到更多的问题。

The best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread protruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it just gets longer and longer. So don't require a question to be obviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict that. It's hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to predict how much will unravel if you pull on it.

  

最好的问题是在回答中成长的。你注意到从当前范式中突出的一条线索，并试图拉住它，它只是变得越来越长。所以，在你尝试回答之前，不要要求问题明显很大。你很少能预测到这一点。即使注意到线索已经很困难，更不用说预测如果你拉住它会有多少会解开。

It's better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on a lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start lots of small things.

  

最好是漫无目的地好奇——拉扯许多线索的一小部分，看看会发生什么。大事都是从小事开始的。大事的初始版本通常只是实验，或副项目，或谈话，然后逐渐发展成为更大的事物。所以开始许多小事。

Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try, the greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand, though, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of things that don't work. You can't have a lot of good ideas without also having a lot of bad ones.

\[[21](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f21n)\]  

创作力被低估了。你尝试的事情越多，发现新事物的机会就越大。但要知道，尝试很多事也意味着尝试很多行不通的事。没有很多坏主意，也就不会有那么多好主意。\[21\]

Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything that's been done before, you'll learn faster and have more fun by trying stuff. And you'll understand previous work better when you do look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when starting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like two puzzle pieces.

  

尽管从研究之前所有的工作开始听起来更负责任，但通过尝试新事物，你会学得更快，更有趣。当你真正去研究它时，你也会更好地理解之前的工作。所以，选择开始吧。当开始意味着从小处着手时，这两者就像两块拼图一样契合。

How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By making successive versions. Great things are almost always made in successive versions. You start with something small and evolve it, and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than anything you could have planned.

  

从从小处着手到做成伟大事业，是通过制作连续版本。几乎所有伟大事物都是通过连续版本制作出来的。你从一个小的东西开始，并逐步进化它，最终版本既比你能计划的更聪明，也更雄心勃勃。

It's particularly useful to make successive versions when you're making something for people — to get an initial version in front of them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response.

  

制作连续版本特别有用，当你为人们制作东西时——快速展示给他们一个初始版本，然后根据他们的反馈进行改进。

Begin by trying the simplest thing that could possibly work. Surprisingly often, it does. If it doesn't, this will at least get you started.

  

开始尝试最简单可能可行的事情。令人惊讶的是，这通常奏效。如果不行，这至少能让你开始。

Don't try to cram too much new stuff into any one version. There are names for doing this with the first version (taking too long to ship) and the second (the second system effect), but these are both merely instances of a more general principle.

  

不要试图在一个版本中塞入太多新内容。对于第一个版本（发布时间过长）和第二个版本（第二个系统效应）都有相应的名称，但这些都是更普遍原则的例子。

An early version of a new project will sometimes be dismissed as a toy. It's a good sign when people do this. That means it has everything a new idea needs except scale, and that tends to follow.

\[[22](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f22n)\]  

一个新项目的早期版本有时会被视为玩具。当人们这样做时，这是一个好兆头。这意味着它拥有一个新想法所需的一切，除了规模，而这通常会随之而来。\[22\]

The alternative to starting with something small and evolving it is to plan in advance what you're going to do. And planning does usually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organized to say "we're going to do x and then y and then z" than "we're going to try x and see what happens." And it is more *organized*; it just doesn't work as well.

  

选择从小处着手并逐步发展，不如提前规划你要做什么。通常，规划看起来是更负责任的选择。说“我们将先做 x，然后做 y，接着做 z”听起来比说“我们将尝试 x，看看会发生什么”更有条理。确实更有条理；只是效果并不好。

Planning per se isn't good. It's sometimes necessary, but it's a necessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It's something you have to do because you're working with inflexible media, or because you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If you keep projects small and use flexible media, you don't have to plan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.

  

本身规划并不好。有时是必要的，但它是一种必要的恶——对严酷条件的回应。这是你必须做的事情，因为你正在与僵化的媒介合作，或者因为你需要协调许多人的努力。如果你将项目保持小型并使用灵活的媒介，你就不需要做太多规划，你的设计可以演变。

Take as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk is proportionate to reward, so don't look for certainty, but for a bet with high expected value. If you're not failing occasionally, you're probably being too conservative.

  

承担你能够承受的风险。在有效市场中，风险与回报成正比，所以不要寻求确定性，而要寻找预期价值高的赌注。如果你偶尔不失败，你可能过于保守了。

Though conservatism is usually associated with the old, it's the young who tend to make this mistake. Inexperience makes them fear risk, but it's when you're young that you can afford the most.

  

尽管保守主义通常与老年人相关联，但往往是年轻人犯这个错误。缺乏经验使他们害怕风险，但正是年轻时你最能承担风险。

Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working on it, you'll have crossed territory few others have seen, and encountered questions few others have asked. And there's probably no better source of questions than the ones you encounter in trying to do something slightly too hard.

  

即使失败的项目也有价值。在努力工作的过程中，你将进入别人很少涉足的领域，遇到别人很少提出的问题。在尝试做一些稍微有点难度的事情时，你遇到的这些问题可能没有比这更好的来源了。

Use the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages of age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy, time, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge, efficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of the latter when young and keep some of the former when old.

  

利用年轻时拥有的青春优势，一旦拥有，就利用年龄的优势。青春的优势是精力、时间、乐观和自由。年龄的优势是知识、效率、金钱和权力。年轻时努力可以获取一些后者，年老时保留一些前者。

The old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages they have. The young often have them without realizing it. The biggest is probably time. The young have no idea how rich they are in time. The best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightly frivolous ways: to learn about something you don't need to know about, just out of curiosity, or to try building something just because it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something.

  

老年人也有优势，那就是知道他们有哪些优势。年轻人往往拥有这些优势，却并未意识到。最大的优势可能是时间。年轻人根本不知道他们在时间上有多么富裕。将这段时间转化为优势的最好方法就是用一些稍微轻率的方式：出于好奇心去了解一些你不需要知道的事情，或者尝试建造一些仅仅因为酷而做的事情，或者成为某方面的怪才。

That "slightly" is an important qualification. Spend time lavishly when you're young, but don't simply waste it. There's a big difference between doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doing something you know for sure will be. The former is at least a bet, and possibly a better one than you think.

\[[23](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f23n)\]  

那“稍微”是一个重要的限定词。年轻时尽情地花钱，但不要简单地浪费。担心某件事可能是浪费时间与确信某件事一定会浪费之间有很大的区别。前者至少是一个赌注，可能比你想象的还要好。\[23\]

The most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience, is that you're seeing everything with fresh eyes. When your brain embraces an idea for the first time, sometimes the two don't fit together perfectly. Usually the problem is with your brain, but occasionally it's with the idea. A piece of it sticks out awkwardly and jabs you when you think about it. People who are used to the idea have learned to ignore it, but you have the opportunity not to.

\[[24](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f24n)\]  

青春最微妙的优点，或者说是不经验之见的优点，就是你能以全新的视角看待一切。当你的大脑第一次接受一个想法时，有时两者并不完美地契合。通常问题出在你的大脑上，但有时也出在想法本身。其中一部分显得有些笨拙，当你思考时它会刺痛你。习惯了这个想法的人已经学会了忽略它，但你有机会不这么做。\[24\]

So when you're learning about something for the first time, pay attention to things that seem wrong or missing. You'll be tempted to ignore them, since there's a 99% chance the problem is with you. And you may have to set aside your misgivings temporarily to keep progressing. But don't forget about them. When you've gotten further into the subject, come back and check if they're still there. If they're still viable in the light of your present knowledge, they probably represent an undiscovered idea.

  

所以当你第一次学习某样东西时，要注意那些看起来不对或缺失的地方。你可能会想忽略它们，因为 99%的可能性问题出在你自己身上。你可能不得不暂时放下你的疑虑，以继续前进。但不要忘记它们。当你对主题有了更深入的了解后，回来检查它们是否仍然存在。如果它们在你的现有知识中仍然可行，它们可能代表了一个未发现的想法。

One of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experience is to know what you *don't* have to worry about. The young know all the things that could matter, but not their relative importance. So they worry equally about everything, when they should worry much more about a few things and hardly at all about the rest.

  

从经验中获得的最有价值的知识之一是知道哪些事情不必担心。年轻人知道所有可能重要的事情，但不知道它们的相对重要性。因此，他们对所有事情都同等担心，而他们应该更多地担心少数几件事情，而对其他事情几乎不必担心。

But what you don't know is only half the problem with inexperience. The other half is what you do know that ain't so. You arrive at adulthood with your head full of nonsense — bad habits you've acquired and false things you've been taught — and you won't be able to do great work till you clear away at least the nonsense in the way of whatever type of work you want to do.

  

但你不知道的只是缺乏经验问题的一半。另一半是你知道却不对的东西。你带着满脑子的胡言乱语进入成年——你养成的坏习惯和被教导的错误观念——除非你清理掉至少阻碍你想要从事的任何类型工作的胡言乱语，否则你将无法做出伟大的工作。

Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools. We're so used to schools that we unconsciously treat going to school as identical with learning, but in fact schools have all sorts of strange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking.

  

许多留在你头脑中的胡言乱语是学校留下的。我们习惯了学校，以至于不知不觉中将上学等同于学习，但事实上，学校具有各种奇怪的特质，扭曲了我们对学习和思考的看法。

For example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child, there was an authority at the front of the class telling all of you what you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neither classes nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they're just artifacts of the way schools are usually designed.

  

例如，学校培养了被动性。自从你还是一个小孩，就有权威站在教室前面告诉你们必须学习什么，然后衡量你们是否做到了。但课堂和考试并非学习的本质；它们只是学校通常设计方式的产物。

The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you're still in school, try thinking of your education as your project, and your teachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That may seem a stretch, but it's not merely some weird thought experiment. It's the truth economically, and in the best case it's the truth intellectually as well. The best teachers don't want to be your bosses. They'd prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source of advice, rather than being pulled by them through the material.

  

越早克服这种被动，越好。如果你还在学校，试着把你的教育看作是你的项目，把你的老师看作是在为你工作，而不是相反。这可能听起来有些牵强，但这不仅仅是一个奇怪的思维实验。从经济角度看，这是真理，在最好的情况下，从智力角度看也是真理。最好的老师不希望成为你的老板。他们更希望你能主动前进，利用他们作为建议的来源，而不是被他们拉着通过材料。

Schools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like. In school they tell you what the problems are, and they're almost always soluble using no more than you've been taught so far. In real life you have to figure out what the problems are, and you often don't know if they're soluble at all.

  

学校也给你一个关于工作是什么样的误导性印象。在学校，他们告诉你问题是什么，而且几乎总是可以用你到目前为止所学的知识来解决。在现实生活中，你必须弄清楚问题是什么，而且你通常不知道这些问题是否可以解决。

But perhaps the worst thing schools do to you is train you to win by hacking the test. You can't do great work by doing that. You can't trick God. So stop looking for that kind of shortcut. The way to beat the system is to focus on problems and solutions that others have overlooked, not to skimp on the work itself.

  

但是学校对你做的最糟糕的事情可能是训练你通过作弊来赢得考试。通过那种方式，你无法做出伟大的工作。你不能欺骗上帝。所以，停止寻找那种捷径。打败系统的办法是专注于别人忽视的问题和解决方案，而不是在实际上偷工减料。

Don't think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving you a "big break." Even if this were true, the best way to get it would be to focus on doing good work rather than chasing influential people.

  

不要把自己视为依赖于某个守门人给你一个“大突破”。即使这是真的，最好的办法是专注于做好工作，而不是追逐有影响力的人。

And don't take rejection by committees to heart. The qualities that impress admissions officers and prize committees are quite different from those required to do great work. The decisions of selection committees are only meaningful to the extent that they're part of a feedback loop, and very few are.

  

不要把委员会的拒绝放在心上。给招生官员和奖项委员会留下深刻印象的品质与完成伟大工作所需品质截然不同。选拔委员会的决定只有在它们是反馈循环的一部分时才有意义，而且为数很少。

People new to a field will often copy existing work. There's nothing inherently bad about that. There's no better way to learn how something works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor does copying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the presence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones.

  

新手进入一个领域时通常会复制现有的工作。这本身并没有什么不好。没有比尝试重现它更好的学习事物工作原理的方法了。复制也不一定使你的工作失去原创性。原创性在于新想法的存在，而不是旧想法的缺失。

There's a good way to copy and a bad way. If you're going to copy something, do it openly instead of furtively, or worse still, unconsciously. This is what's meant by the famously misattributed phrase "Great artists steal." The really dangerous kind of copying, the kind that gives copying a bad name, is the kind that's done without realizing it, because you're nothing more than a train running on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the other extreme, copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination.

\[[25](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f25n)\]  

有好的复制方法和不好的方法。如果你要复制某物，公开地做，而不是偷偷摸摸，更糟糕的是，不知不觉地做。这就是那句著名误传的格言“伟大的艺术家偷窃”的含义。真正危险的一种复制，那种给复制带来坏名声的复制，是那种没有意识到做的，因为你不过是在别人铺设的轨道上运行的火车。但另一方面，复制可以是一种优越性的标志，而不是服从性的标志。\[25\]

In many fields it's almost inevitable that your early work will be in some sense based on other people's. Projects rarely arise in a vacuum. They're usually a reaction to previous work. When you're first starting out, you don't have any previous work; if you're going to react to something, it has to be someone else's. Once you're established, you can react to your own. But while the former gets called derivative and the latter doesn't, structurally the two cases are more similar than they seem.

  

在许多领域，你的早期工作在某种程度上都是基于他人的。项目很少是凭空出现的。它们通常是对先前工作的反应。当你刚开始时，你没有先前的作品；如果你要反应某件事，那必须是别人的。一旦你站稳了脚跟，你就可以反应自己的。但尽管前者被称为模仿，后者则不然，从结构上看，这两种情况比它们看起来更为相似。

Oddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimes makes them seem at first to be more derivative than they are. New discoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations of existing things, *even by their discoverers*, because there isn't yet the conceptual vocabulary to express them.

  

奇怪的是，最创新的想法的非常新颖性有时使它们最初看起来比实际上更具有派生性。新的发现通常最初必须被构想为现有事物的变体，甚至是由它们的发现者，因为还没有概念词汇来表达它们。

There are definitely some dangers to copying, though. One is that you'll tend to copy old things — things that were in their day at the frontier of knowledge, but no longer are.

  

确实，复制也有一些危险。其中之一是你倾向于复制旧事物——那些曾经是知识前沿的事物，但现在已经不再是了。

And when you do copy something, don't copy every feature of it. Some will make you ridiculous if you do. Don't copy the manner of an eminent 50 year old professor if you're 18, for example, or the idiom of a Renaissance poem hundreds of years later.

  

当你复制某物时，不要复制它的每一个特性。有些特性如果你这样做会让你显得荒谬。比如，如果你 18 岁，就不要模仿一位 50 岁的著名教授的举止，或者几百年后模仿文艺复兴时期诗歌的习语。

Some of the features of things you admire are flaws they succeeded despite. Indeed, the features that are easiest to imitate are the most likely to be the flaws.

  

一些你钦佩的事物的特点，正是它们成功克服的缺陷。事实上，最容易模仿的特点往往是最可能成为缺陷的。

This is particularly true for behavior. Some talented people are jerks, and this sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced that being a jerk is part of being talented. It isn't; being talented is merely how they get away with it.

  

这尤其适用于行为。有些有才华的人很讨厌，这有时会让没有经验的人觉得讨厌是才华的一部分。并不是这样；有才华只是他们逃避惩罚的方式。

One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from one field into another. History is so full of chance discoveries of this type that it's probably worth giving chance a hand by deliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas from quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors.

  

一种最强大的复制方式是将一种领域的东西复制到另一种领域。历史充满了这类偶然的发现，可能值得通过有意识地了解其他类型的工作来帮助偶然。如果你让它们成为隐喻，你可以从相当遥远的领域汲取灵感。

Negative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact you can sometimes learn more from things done badly than from things done well; sometimes it only becomes clear what's needed when it's missing.

  

负面例子可以和正面例子一样鼓舞人心。事实上，有时从做得不好的事情中可以学到比做得好的事情更多的东西；有时只有当它缺失时，才变得清楚需要什么。

If a lot of the best people in your field are collected in one place, it's usually a good idea to visit for a while. It will increase your ambition, and also, by showing you that these people are human, increase your self-confidence.

\[[26](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f26n)\]  

如果你们领域的许多优秀人才都聚集在一个地方，那么去那里待一段时间通常是个好主意。这会提升你的雄心，同时，通过向你展示这些人也是凡人，也能增强你的自信心。\[26\]

If you're earnest you'll probably get a warmer welcome than you might expect. Most people who are very good at something are happy to talk about it with anyone who's genuinely interested. If they're really good at their work, then they probably have a hobbyist's interest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about their hobbies.

  

如果你真诚，你可能会得到比你预期的更热烈的欢迎。大多数在某件事上非常出色的人都会很高兴与任何真正感兴趣的人谈论它。如果他们在工作中真的很出色，那么他们可能对它有着业余爱好者的兴趣，而业余爱好者总是想谈论他们的爱好。

It may take some effort to find the people who are really good, though. Doing great work has such prestige that in some places, particularly universities, there's a polite fiction that everyone is engaged in it. And that is far from true. People within universities can't say so openly, but the quality of the work being done in different departments varies immensely. Some departments have people doing great work; others have in the past; others never have.

  

可能需要一些努力才能找到真正优秀的人。出色的工作具有如此高的声望，在一些地方，尤其是在大学里，存在一种礼貌的虚构，即每个人都从事这项工作。但这远非事实。大学内部的人不能公开这么说，但不同部门的工作质量差异很大。有些部门有人在做出色的工作；有些部门过去曾经做过；而有些部门从未做过。

Seek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can't be done alone, and even if you're working on one that can be, it's good to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.

  

寻找最佳同事。有很多项目无法单独完成，即使你在做可以单独完成的项目，有其他人鼓励你，互相交流想法也是好的。

Colleagues don't just affect your work, though; they also affect you. So work with people you want to become like, because you will.

  

同事不仅影响你的工作，还影响你。所以和那些你想成为的人一起工作，因为你会的。

Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It's better to have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good ones. In fact it's not merely better, but necessary, judging from history: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests that one's colleagues often make the difference between doing great work and not.

  

质量比数量在同事中更重要。拥有一两个优秀的人比拥有一栋满是相当不错的人的楼更好。事实上，从历史来看，伟大工作集群发生的程度表明，一个人的同事往往决定了是否能够完成伟大的工作。

How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In my experience, when you do, you know. Which means if you're unsure, you probably don't. But it may be possible to give a more concrete answer than that. Here's an attempt: sufficiently good colleagues offer *surprising* insights. They can see and do things that you can't. So if you have a handful of colleagues good enough to keep you on your toes in this sense, you're probably over the threshold.

  

你知道何时拥有足够好的同事吗？在我的经验中，当你拥有时，你就知道了。这意味着如果你不确定，你可能还没有。但也许可以给出比这更具体的答案。这里是一个尝试：足够好的同事能提供令人惊讶的见解。他们能看到和做到你做不到的事情。所以，如果你有一群足够好的同事，能让你保持警惕，那么你很可能已经超过了这个门槛。

Most of us can benefit from collaborating with colleagues, but some projects require people on a larger scale, and starting one of those is not for everyone. If you want to run a project like that, you'll have to become a manager, and managing well takes aptitude and interest like any other kind of work. If you don't have them, there is no middle path: you must either force yourself to learn management as a second language, or avoid such projects.

\[[27](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f27n)\]  

我们大多数人都能从与同事合作中受益，但有些项目需要更大规模的人员，而启动这样的项目并非适合每个人。如果你想管理这样的项目，你必须成为一名管理者，而良好的管理需要像其他任何工作一样具备天赋和兴趣。如果你不具备这些，没有折中的道路：你必须要么强迫自己将管理作为第二语言来学习，要么避免这样的项目。\[27\]

Husband your morale. It's the basis of everything when you're working on ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a living organism.

  

丈夫，保持你的士气。当你致力于宏伟项目时，这是基础。你必须像呵护一个生物体一样滋养和保护它。

Morale starts with your view of life. You're more likely to do great work if you're an optimist, and more likely to if you think of yourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim.

  

士气始于你对生活的看法。如果你是个乐观主义者，你更有可能做出出色的工作，如果你认为自己很幸运，那么你更有可能这样做，而不是如果你认为自己是个受害者。

Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If you choose work that's pure, its very difficulties will serve as a refuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism, it's a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by some of the greatest minds in history.

  

确实，工作在一定程度上可以保护你免受问题的困扰。如果你选择纯粹的工作，它极大的困难将作为逃避日常生活的困难的一种庇护。如果这是逃避，那它是一种非常富有成效的逃避方式，也是历史上一些最伟大思想家所采用的方式。

Morale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, which increases your morale and helps you do even better work. But this cycle also operates in the other direction: if you're not doing good work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to. Since it matters so much for this cycle to be running in the right direction, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work when you're stuck, just so you start to get something done.

  

士气通过工作而增强：高士气帮助你做好工作，这又提高了你的士气，并帮助你做得更好。但这个循环也可以反向运作：如果你没有做好工作，那可能会让你士气低落，并使你更难做好。鉴于这个循环必须正确运行，所以在你陷入困境时，切换到更容易的工作可能是个好主意，这样你就可以开始做一些事情。

One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow setbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting. You can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering setbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always involves some backtracking.

  

有志者常犯的最大错误之一是让挫折一次性摧毁他们的士气，就像气球爆炸一样。你可以通过明确地将挫折视为你过程的一部分来对此进行免疫。解决难题总是涉及一些回溯。

Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the desire to. So "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" isn't quite right. It should be: If at first you don't succeed, either try again, or backtrack and then try again.

  

做好工作是一种深度优先搜索，其根节点是欲望。所以“如果一开始不成功，就再试一次”并不完全正确。它应该是：如果一开始不成功，要么再试一次，要么回溯然后再试一次。

"Never give up" is also not quite right. Obviously there are times when it's the right choice to eject. A more precise version would be: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you need to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.

  

永不放弃也不是完全正确。显然，有时候退出是正确的选择。一个更精确的说法是：永远不要让挫折让你过度回退。推论：永远不要放弃根节点。

It's not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more than it's a bad sign to be out of breath while running. It depends how fast you're running. So learn to distinguish good pain from bad. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage.

  

工作遇到困难并不一定是坏事，就像跑步时喘不过气来也不一定是坏事一样。这取决于你跑得多快。所以学会区分好痛和坏痛。好痛是努力的标志；坏痛是损伤的标志。

An audience is a critical component of morale. If you're a scholar, your audience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audience in the traditional sense. Either way it doesn't need to be big. The value of an audience doesn't grow anything like linearly with its size. Which is bad news if you're famous, but good news if you're just starting out, because it means a small but dedicated audience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of people genuinely love what you're doing, that's enough.

  

观众是士气的关键组成部分。如果你是一位学者，你的观众可能是你的同行；在艺术领域，它可能是指传统意义上的观众。无论如何，它不需要很大。观众的价值并不像其规模那样线性增长。这对名人来说是个坏消息，但对你刚开始起步的人来说是个好消息，因为这意味着一个小而忠实的观众就足以支持你。如果有一小部分人真正喜欢你所做的事情，那就足够了。

To the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come between you and your audience. In some types of work this is inevitable, but it's so liberating to escape it that you might be better off switching to an adjacent type if that will let you go direct.

\[[28](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f28n)\]  

尽量不让中间人插足于你和你的观众之间。在某些类型的工作中这是不可避免的，但摆脱这种束缚是如此自由，如果你可以通过转换到相邻类型来实现直接接触，你可能更好。 \[28\]

The people you spend time with will also have a big effect on your morale. You'll find there are some who increase your energy and others who decrease it, and the effect someone has is not always what you'd expect. Seek out the people who increase your energy and avoid those who decrease it. Though of course if there's someone you need to take care of, that takes precedence.

  

你花时间相处的人也会对你的士气产生重大影响。你会发现有些人会增加你的能量，而有些人则会减少它，某人对你的影响并不总是你所预期的。寻找那些能增加你能量的人，避免那些会减少你能量的人。当然，如果你需要照顾的人，那当然要优先考虑。

Don't marry someone who doesn't understand that you need to work, or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you're ambitious, you need to work; it's almost like a medical condition; so someone who won't let you work either doesn't understand you, or does and doesn't care.

  

不要嫁给一个不理解你需要工作，或者把你的工作看作是对你注意力的竞争的人。如果你有抱负，你需要工作；这几乎就像是一种医疗状况；所以不让你工作的人要么不理解你，要么理解了却不在乎。

Ultimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it's important to take care of it. That means exercising regularly, eating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of drugs. Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercise because they're good for thinking.

\[[29](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f29n)\]  

最终，士气是身体上的。你用身体思考，所以照顾好它是很重要的。这意味着要定期锻炼，吃得好，睡得好，并避免更危险的药物。跑步和散步是特别好的锻炼形式，因为它们对思考有益。\[29\]

People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone else, but they're happier than they'd be if they didn't. In fact, if you're smart and ambitious, it's dangerous *not* to be productive. People who are smart and ambitious but don't achieve much tend to become bitter.

  

人们做得很出色的工作并不一定比其他人更快乐，但他们比不这样做时更快乐。事实上，如果你聪明又有抱负，不努力工作是很危险的。聪明又有抱负但成就不多的人往往会变得痛苦。

It's ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people. The opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the opinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, just adds noise.

  

想给其他人留下深刻印象是可以的，但请选择正确的人。你尊重的人的看法是信号。名声，即一个可能或可能不尊重的更大群体的看法，只是增加了噪音。

The prestige of a type of work is at best a trailing indicator and sometimes completely mistaken. If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. So the question to ask about a type of work is not how much prestige it has, but how well it could be done.

  

一种工作的声望至多是一个滞后指标，有时甚至完全错误。如果你把任何事情做到足够好，你就能让它变得有声望。所以关于一种工作的提问不应该是它有多少声望，而应该是它能够做得有多好。

Competition can be an effective motivator, but don't let it choose the problem for you; don't let yourself get drawn into chasing something just because others are. In fact, don't let competitors make you do anything much more specific than work harder.

  

竞争可以是一个有效的激励因素，但不要让它为你选择问题；不要让自己仅仅因为别人而追逐某件事。事实上，不要让竞争对手让你做任何事情比更加努力工作更具体。

Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to.

  

好奇心是最好的向导。你的好奇心从不说谎，它比你更清楚什么值得关注。

Notice how often that word has come up. If you asked an oracle the secret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single word, my bet would be on "curiosity."

  

注意这个词出现的频率有多高。如果你问一个神谕如何做好工作的秘诀，而神谕用一个词回答，我会赌“好奇心”。

That doesn't translate directly to advice. It's not enough just to be curious, and you can't command curiosity anyway. But you can nurture it and let it drive you.

  

这不能直接转化为建议。仅仅好奇是不够的，而且你无论如何也无法命令好奇心。但你可以培养它，让它引导你。

Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole process is a kind of dance with curiosity.

  

好奇心是做好所有四步的关键：它会为你选择领域，带你到达前沿，让你注意到其中的差距，并驱使你探索它们。整个过程是一种与好奇心的舞蹈。

Believe it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could. But its length at least means it acts as a filter. If you made it this far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if so you're already further along than you might realize, because the set of people willing to want to is small.

  

信不信由你，我尽量让这篇论文尽可能简短。但它的长度至少意味着它起到了筛选作用。如果你已经读到这儿，那你一定对做好工作感兴趣。而且，如果你是这样的话，你已经比你自己意识到的走得更远了，因为愿意想要这样做的人很少。

The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal, mathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and luck. Luck by definition you can't do anything about, so we can ignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to do great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest. Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will combine to yield an explosion of new ideas?

  

做伟大工作的因素在字面和数学意义上都是因素，它们是：能力、兴趣、努力和运气。运气按照定义，你无法控制，所以我们可以忽略它。如果我们假设你确实想要做伟大的工作，那么问题就归结为能力和兴趣。你能找到一种工作，让你的能力和兴趣结合，产生新的想法的爆炸吗？

Here there are grounds for optimism. There are so many different ways to do great work, and even more that are still undiscovered. Out of all those different types of work, the one you're most suited for is probably a pretty close match. Probably a comically close match. It's just a question of finding it, and how far into it your ability and interest can take you. And you can only answer that by trying.

  

这里有很多理由保持乐观。有如此多的方式可以完成伟大的工作，还有更多尚未被发现的方法。在所有这些不同类型的工作中，最适合你的可能是一个相当接近的匹配。可能是一个滑稽的接近匹配。这只是一个找到它的问题，以及你的能力和兴趣能带你走多远。而唯一能回答这个问题的方式就是尝试。

Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds them back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous to try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely if you tried something like that, you'd fail. Presumably the calculation is rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to do great work. But that's what's going on subconsciously; they shy away from the question.

  

许多人本可以尝试做出伟大的工作，但阻止他们的却是谦逊和恐惧的结合。试图成为牛顿或莎士比亚似乎有些自以为是。这也似乎很困难；如果你尝试了类似的事情，你肯定会失败。这种计算很少是明确的。很少有人会自觉地决定不去尝试做出伟大的工作。但潜意识里就是这样发生的；他们回避这个问题。

So I'm going to pull a sneaky trick on you. Do you want to do great work, or not? Now you have to decide consciously. Sorry about that. I wouldn't have done it to a general audience. But we already know you're interested.

  

所以我将对你玩一个狡猾的把戏。你想要做出伟大的工作，还是不？现在你必须有意识地做出决定。对此表示歉意。我不会对一般观众这么做。但我们已经知道你感兴趣。

Don't worry about being presumptuous. You don't have to tell anyone. And if it's too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have worse problems than that. In fact you'll be lucky if it's the worst problem you have.

  

别担心显得自以为是。你不必告诉任何人。而且如果太难而失败了，那又怎样？很多人比这有更糟糕的问题。事实上，如果这是你遇到的最糟糕的问题，那你已经很幸运了。

Yes, you'll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to work hard. And if you're working on something you find very interesting, which you necessarily will if you're on the right path, the work will probably feel less burdensome than a lot of your peers'.

  

是的，你将不得不努力工作。但再次强调，很多人都需要努力工作。而且如果你在做一件你非常感兴趣的事情，如果你走对了路，那么这份工作可能比你周围很多人感觉到的要轻松得多。

The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made. Why not by you?

  

探索就在那里，等待着被发现。为何不让你来完成？

**Notes  注释**

\[

1\] I don't think you could give a precise definition of what counts as great work. Doing great work means doing something important so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible. But there's no threshold for importance. It's a matter of degree, and often hard to judge at the time anyway. So I'd rather people focused on developing their interests rather than worrying about whether they're important or not. Just try to do something amazing, and leave it to future generations to say if you succeeded.  

我认为你无法精确地定义什么算是伟大的作品。做伟大的工作意味着做某件重要的事情，做得如此之好以至于你扩展了人们对可能性的认识。但并没有一个重要性的门槛。这是一个程度问题，而且通常在那时很难判断。所以，我更希望人们专注于发展他们的兴趣，而不是担心它们是否重要。只需尽力做一些惊人的事情，然后留给未来的一代人去评判你是否成功。

\[

2\] A lot of standup comedy is based on noticing anomalies in everyday life. "Did you ever notice...?" New ideas come from doing this about nontrivial things. Which may help explain why people's reaction to a new idea is often the first half of laughing: Ha!  

\[2\] 许多单口喜剧都是基于注意日常生活中异常现象。 "你有没有注意到...？" 从非平凡事物中这样做会带来新想法。 这也许可以解释为什么人们对新想法的反应通常是笑声的第一半：哈哈！

\[

3\] That second qualifier is critical. If you're excited about something most authorities discount, but you can't give a more precise explanation than "they don't get it," then you're starting to drift into the territory of cranks.  

\[3\] 第二个标准至关重要。如果你对大多数人都不看好的事物感到兴奋，但你无法给出比“他们不懂”更精确的解释，那么你已经开始进入狂热者的领域了。

\[

4\] Finding something to work on is not simply a matter of finding a match between the current version of you and a list of known problems. You'll often have to coevolve with the problem. That's why it can sometimes be so hard to figure out what to work on. The search space is huge. It's the cartesian product of all possible types of work, both known and yet to be discovered, and all possible future versions of you.  

找到可以着手解决的问题并不仅仅是找到你当前版本与已知问题列表之间的匹配。你通常需要与问题共同进化。这就是为什么有时很难确定要做什么。搜索空间巨大。它是所有可能类型的工作（已知和尚未发现的）以及你所有可能未来版本的笛卡尔积。

There's no way you could search this whole space, so you have to rely on heuristics to generate promising paths through it and hope the best matches will be clustered. Which they will not always be; different types of work have been collected together as much by accidents of history as by the intrinsic similarities between them.

  

无法搜索整个空间，因此您必须依赖启发式方法来生成有希望的路径，并希望最佳匹配将聚集在一起。但这并不总是会发生；不同类型的工作被收集在一起，既是因为历史的偶然，也是因为它们之间的内在相似性。

\[

5\] There are many reasons curious people are more likely to do great work, but one of the more subtle is that, by casting a wide net, they're more likely to find the right thing to work on in the first place.  

好奇的人更有可能做出杰出工作的原因有很多，但其中较为微妙的一个原因是，通过撒大网，他们更有可能在最初就找到正确的工作方向。

\[

6\] It can also be dangerous to make things for an audience you feel is less sophisticated than you, if that causes you to talk down to them. You can make a lot of money doing that, if you do it in a sufficiently cynical way, but it's not the route to great work. Not that anyone using this m.o. would care.  

\[6\] 如果这样做让你对他们说教，那么为那些你认为不如你世故的观众制作东西也是危险的。如果你足够愤世嫉俗地做这件事，你可以赚很多钱，但这不是通往伟大作品的途径。当然，采用这种方法的任何人都不在乎这一点。

\[

7\] This idea I learned from Hardy's *A Mathematician's Apology*, which I recommend to anyone ambitious to do great work, in any field.  

\[7\] 我从哈代的《一个数学家的辩护》中了解到这个想法，我推荐给任何有志于在任何领域做出伟大工作的人。

\[

8\] Just as we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do over several years, we overestimate the damage done by procrastinating for a day and underestimate the damage done by procrastinating for several years.  

正如我们高估了自己一天能做的事情，低估了自己几年能做的事情，我们也高估了拖延一天造成的损害，低估了拖延几年造成的损害。

\[

9\] You can't usually get paid for doing exactly what you want, especially early on. There are two options: get paid for doing work close to what you want and hope to push it closer, or get paid for doing something else entirely and do your own projects on the side. Both can work, but both have drawbacks: in the first approach your work is compromised by default, and in the second you have to fight to get time to do it.  

通常你不能只为做自己想做的事情而获得报酬，尤其是在早期。有两种选择：为接近你想要的工作内容而获得报酬，并希望将其推向更近，或者为完全不同的工作内容获得报酬，并在旁边做自己的项目。两者都可以行得通，但都有缺点：在第一种方法中，你的工作默认会受到妥协，而在第二种方法中，你必须争取时间来做它。

\[

10\] If you set your life up right, it will deliver the focus-relax cycle automatically. The perfect setup is an office you work in and that you walk to and from.  

如果你把生活安排得当，它将自动提供专注-放松周期。完美的设置是一个你工作的地方，也是你往返的地方。

\[

11\] There may be some very unworldly people who do great work without consciously trying to. If you want to expand this rule to cover that case, it becomes: Don't try to be anything except the best.  

\[11\] 可能有一些非常超凡脱俗的人，他们不自觉地做出伟大的工作。如果你想将这个规则扩展到这种情况，那么它就变成了：不要试图成为除了最好的以外的任何东西。

\[

12\] This gets more complicated in work like acting, where the goal is to adopt a fake persona. But even here it's possible to be affected. Perhaps the rule in such fields should be to avoid *unintentional* affectation.  

\[12\] 在像表演这样的工作中，目标是要扮演一个假角色，这会变得更加复杂。但即便如此，也可能会受到影响。或许在这些领域，规则应该是避免无意识的做作。

\[

13\] It's safe to have beliefs that you treat as unquestionable if and only if they're also unfalsifiable. For example, it's safe to have the principle that everyone should be treated equally under the law, because a sentence with a "should" in it isn't really a statement about the world and is therefore hard to disprove. And if there's no evidence that could disprove one of your principles, there can't be any facts you'd need to ignore in order to preserve it.  

只有当这些信念也是不可证伪的，你才能认为它们是无条件的信念。例如，认为每个人都应该在法律面前受到平等对待的原则是安全的，因为包含“应该”的句子并不是对世界的陈述，因此很难被反驳。如果没有证据可以反驳你的任何一个原则，那么就没有任何事实是你需要忽略以保持它的。

\[

14\] Affectation is easier to cure than intellectual dishonesty. Affectation is often a shortcoming of the young that burns off in time, while intellectual dishonesty is more of a character flaw.  

\[14\] 装腔作势比智力不诚实更容易治愈。装腔作势往往是年轻人的一种短处，随着时间的推移会逐渐消失，而智力不诚实则更多是一种性格缺陷。

\[

15\] Obviously you don't have to be working at the exact moment you have the idea, but you'll probably have been working fairly recently.  

显然你不必在产生想法的 precisely 那一刻工作，但你可能最近一直在工作。

\[

16\] Some say psychoactive drugs have a similar effect. I'm skeptical, but also almost totally ignorant of their effects.  

有些人说精神活性药物有类似的效果。我持怀疑态度，但对自己几乎一无所知。

\[

17\] For example you might give the nth most important topic (m-1)/m^n of your attention, for some m > 1. You couldn't allocate your attention so precisely, of course, but this at least gives an idea of a reasonable distribution.  

例如，您可能将第 n 个最重要的话题分配给(m-1)/m^n 的注意力，其中 m>1。当然，您不可能如此精确地分配注意力，但至少这给出了一种合理的分配思路。

\[

18\] The principles defining a religion have to be mistaken. Otherwise anyone might adopt them, and there would be nothing to distinguish the adherents of the religion from everyone else.  

\[18\] 定义宗教的原则必须是有误的。否则任何人都可以采纳它们，那么宗教信徒与其他人之间就没有什么区别了。

\[

19\] It might be a good exercise to try writing down a list of questions you wondered about in your youth. You might find you're now in a position to do something about some of them.  

\[19\] 尝试写下你在青少年时期所疑惑的问题清单可能是个不错的练习。你可能会发现现在你处于能够解决其中一些问题的位置。

\[

20\] The connection between originality and uncertainty causes a strange phenomenon: because the conventional-minded are more certain than the independent-minded, this tends to give them the upper hand in disputes, even though they're generally stupider.  

\[20\] 原创性与不确定性之间的联系导致了一种奇怪的现象：因为传统思维的人比独立思维的人更确定，这往往使他们处于争论中的优势地位，尽管他们通常更愚蠢。

\[21\]源自林纳斯·托尔瓦德·鲍林的“如果你想有好的想法，你必须有很多想法。”

\[

22\] Attacking a project as a "toy" is similar to attacking a statement as "inappropriate." It means that no more substantial criticism can be made to stick.  

攻击一个项目为“玩具”类似于攻击一个声明为“不恰当”。这意味着无法再提出更多实质性的批评。

\[

23\] One way to tell whether you're wasting time is to ask if you're producing or consuming. Writing computer games is less likely to be a waste of time than playing them, and playing games where you create something is less likely to be a waste of time than playing games where you don't.  

判断你是否浪费时间的一种方法是问自己是在创造还是消费。编写电脑游戏比玩游戏更不容易浪费时间，而玩创造性的游戏比玩不创造性的游戏更不容易浪费时间。

\[

24\] Another related advantage is that if you haven't said anything publicly yet, you won't be biased toward evidence that supports your earlier conclusions. With sufficient integrity you could achieve eternal youth in this respect, but few manage to. For most people, having previously published opinions has an effect similar to ideology, just in quantity 1.  

\[24\] 另一个相关优势是，如果你之前还没有公开说过什么，你不会倾向于支持你早期结论的证据。只要有足够的正直，你在这方面可以实现永恒的青春，但很少有人能成功。对于大多数人来说，之前发表的观点对他们的作用类似于意识形态，只是在数量上有所不同。

\[

25\] In the early 1630s Daniel Mytens made a painting of Henrietta Maria handing a laurel wreath to Charles I. Van Dyck then painted his own version to show how much better he was.  

\[25\] 1630 年代初，丹尼尔·米滕斯创作了一幅画，描绘亨利埃塔·玛丽亚向查理一世赠送桂冠。然后，凡·代克画了自己的版本，以展示他有多么出色。

\[

26\] I'm being deliberately vague about what a place is. As of this writing, being in the same physical place has advantages that are hard to duplicate, but that could change.  

\[26\] 我故意对地点的定义含糊不清。截至写作时，身处同一物理地点具有难以复制的优势，但这可能会改变。

\[

27\] This is false when the work the other people have to do is very constrained, as with SETI@home or Bitcoin. It may be possible to expand the area in which it's false by defining similarly restricted protocols with more freedom of action in the nodes.  

\[27\] 当其他人必须完成的工作非常受限时，例如 SETI@home 或比特币，这是错误的。可能可以通过定义具有更多节点行动自由的类似受限协议来扩大这个错误区域。

\[

28\] Corollary: Building something that enables people to go around intermediaries and engage directly with their audience is probably a good idea.  

推论：构建一个让人们能够绕过中间人并直接与他们的受众互动的东西可能是个好主意。

\[

29\] It may be helpful always to walk or run the same route, because that frees attention for thinking. It feels that way to me, and there is some historical evidence for it.  

\[29\] 总是走或跑相同的路线可能有所帮助，因为这可以释放出注意力用于思考。对我来说感觉就是这样，而且有一些历史证据支持这一点。**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Gackle, Pam Graham, Tom Howard, Patrick Hsu, Steve Huffman, Jessica Livingston, Henry Lloyd-Baker, Bob Metcalfe, Ben Miller, Robert Morris, Michael Nielsen, Courtenay Pipkin, Joris Poort, Mieke Roos, Rajat Suri, Harj Taggar, Garry Tan, and my younger son for suggestions and for reading drafts.
