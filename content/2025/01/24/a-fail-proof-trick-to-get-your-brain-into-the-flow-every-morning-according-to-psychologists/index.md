> **摘要**:
>  本文探讨了如何在工作前期建立良好的工作状态，以提升工作效率和创造力。作者提到自己在写作过程中遇到的难题，特别是在深度专注的工作中，开头常常感到困难。为了解决这一问题，著名信任与科技专家Rachel Botsman提出一个有效的技巧：在前一天的工作结束时，不要完成整段内容，而是故意停在半途中，第二天再继续。这种方法不仅可以为后续的工作提供动力，还能利用大脑对未完成任务的记忆效应（Zeigarnik效应），帮助更轻松地进入工作状态。文章还提到其他成功人士，如亚当·格兰特和欧内斯特·海明威均采取类似策略，以减少写作时面临的空白页恐惧。最后，建议读者在工作结束时有意识地留下未完成的任务，以便次日更顺利地开始新一天的工作。
> 
>  **要点总结**:
>  1. 工作开始时的状态对全天工作有重大影响。
>  2. 理论上，提前在写作中停在半途可以帮助第二天更轻松地回归工作。
>  3. Zeigarnik效应表明未完成的任务会在脑中保持活跃，促进记忆与工作连贯性。
>  4. 许多成功作家和心理学家支持这一策略，认为它能降低面对空白时的压力。
>  5. 建议在结束工作时故意留下未完成的任务，以提高次日工作效率。

Some days, it can feel really hard to start work, especially work that requires deep, focused thinking. I had many moments while writing my latest book where I had a daily writing target to achieve but would instead sit staring at a flashing cursor for 20 minutes before something useful came out of my brain (although on some mornings, “useful” might be overstating things). All I wanted on these days was to get into flow and write, but my brain had other ideas.

Rachel Botsman, a world-renowned expert on trust and technology and the first-ever Trust Fellow at Oxford University, used to love the 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. slot for her writing. She found she could do more work in those three hours than she could achieve during the rest of the day. But when she had kids, that slot disappeared.

While trying to find a new groove for her work having started a family, she discovered that one of the tricks to getting into flow was how she settled herself into work for the day. “How you start is really key to the rest of the day,” Botsman explains.

> “A really easy trick I learned is: if you’re in flow the day before, don’t finish that paragraph. Get halfway through the paragraph, and then stop. Write the next sentence the following day because it makes it really easy to pick up. Days where you’ve completed something, and you’re starting again, they’re harder because you’re starting the engine from scratch.”

Organizational psychologist and Wharton professor Adam Grant uses a similar strategy. He refers to it as parking on a downhill slope, given the ease that this act brings to getting back into flow the following day.

Some people call this idea the Hemingway Trick. Writer Ernest Hemingway once said, “When you are going good, stop writing.” Indeed, he was purported to have stopped each day’s writing session halfway through a sentence. Author Roald Dahl also used the same strategy to avoid the terrifying blank page confronting him in his morning writing sessions.

Not only does finishing halfway through a task give us momentum, it has the added benefit of keeping the information in our brain. Psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik ran [a famous experiment](https://www.psychologistworld.com/memory/zeigarnik-effect-interruptions-memory) in 1927 in which she observed that waiters were better able to remember complex orders when the order was interrupted or incomplete. However, as soon as the order was finished, it faded from memory more quickly. Known as the Zeigarnik Effect, this research demonstrates that our brain hates unfinished business, so much so that it will hold onto the information until it gets closure.

In the case of the Hemingway Trick, our brain continues to think about the unfinished task and when we come back to it, our brain is primed to easily pick up where it left off.

## Put it into action

When you are finishing work for the day, resist the temptation to reach a natural conclusion before clocking off. Instead, deliberately finish halfway through a sentence, a slide, a line of code, or whatever the type of work you are doing. By finishing halfway through, you’ll find it far easier to get started the following day and have a much more time-wise morning.
