> **摘要**:
>  本文探讨了在工作开始时如何有效地进入“流状态”，以提升工作效率。作者分享了Rachel Botsman的经验，强调一天的开始对后续工作的关键作用。她建议在前一天保持流状态时，不要完成段落，而是中途停止，以便在第二天容易接续工作。类似地，Adam Grant也运用了类似策略，称之为在下坡路停车，能更轻松实现回归流状态。文章还提到Hemingway的写作技巧，指出完成一项任务至半途不仅能提供动力，同时有助于记忆的保持，这种现象被称为“Zeigarnik效应”。因此，作者建议在结束工作前故意中途停止，有助于第二天重新开始工作时更加顺利。
> 
>  **要点总结**:
>  1. 一天的开始至关重要，影响后续工作效率。
>  2. 建议在下班时中途停止，不要完成任务，以便第二天容易接续。
>  3. “Hemingway技巧”强调在创作高峰期停止，以保持动力。
>  4. “Zeigarnik效应”说明未完成的任务会留在脑海中，便于后续回忆。
>  5. 采取这种策略能显著提高工作启动的流畅性。

Some days, it can feel really hard to start work, especially work that requires deep, focused thinking. I had many moments while writing my latest book where I had a daily writing target to achieve but would instead sit staring at a flashing cursor for 20 minutes before something useful came out of my brain (although on some mornings, “useful” might be overstating things). All I wanted on these days was to get into flow and write, but my brain had other ideas.

Rachel Botsman, a world-renowned expert on trust and technology and the first-ever Trust Fellow at Oxford University, used to love the 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. slot for her writing. She found she could do more work in those three hours than she could achieve during the rest of the day. But when she had kids, that slot disappeared.

While trying to find a new groove for her work having started a family, she discovered that one of the tricks to getting into flow was how she settled herself into work for the day. “How you start is really key to the rest of the day,” Botsman explains.

> “A really easy trick I learned is: if you’re in flow the day before, don’t finish that paragraph. Get halfway through the paragraph, and then stop. Write the next sentence the following day because it makes it really easy to pick up. Days where you’ve completed something, and you’re starting again, they’re harder because you’re starting the engine from scratch.”

Organizational psychologist and Wharton professor Adam Grant uses a similar strategy. He refers to it as parking on a downhill slope, given the ease that this act brings to getting back into flow the following day.

Some people call this idea the Hemingway Trick. Writer Ernest Hemingway once said, “When you are going good, stop writing.” Indeed, he was purported to have stopped each day’s writing session halfway through a sentence. Author Roald Dahl also used the same strategy to avoid the terrifying blank page confronting him in his morning writing sessions.

Not only does finishing halfway through a task give us momentum, it has the added benefit of keeping the information in our brain. Psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik ran [a famous experiment](https://www.psychologistworld.com/memory/zeigarnik-effect-interruptions-memory) in 1927 in which she observed that waiters were better able to remember complex orders when the order was interrupted or incomplete. However, as soon as the order was finished, it faded from memory more quickly. Known as the Zeigarnik Effect, this research demonstrates that our brain hates unfinished business, so much so that it will hold onto the information until it gets closure.

In the case of the Hemingway Trick, our brain continues to think about the unfinished task and when we come back to it, our brain is primed to easily pick up where it left off.

## Put it into action

When you are finishing work for the day, resist the temptation to reach a natural conclusion before clocking off. Instead, deliberately finish halfway through a sentence, a slide, a line of code, or whatever the type of work you are doing. By finishing halfway through, you’ll find it far easier to get started the following day and have a much more time-wise morning.
