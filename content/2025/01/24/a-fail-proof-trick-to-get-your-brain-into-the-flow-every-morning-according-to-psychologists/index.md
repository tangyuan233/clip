> **摘要**:
>  本文探讨了如何通过合理的“结束”方式来提升工作效率，尤其是在需要深度思考时。作者分享了Rachel Botsman和Adam Grant等专家的经验，强调起始和结束对工作连续性的影响。Botsman发现，前一天处于“流畅状态”时，稍微中断而非完全结束将使得第二天更容易开始。Grant则形象地称之为“在下坡路上停车”，有助于保持工作动能。“海明威技巧”同样基于此思想，主张在写作时尽量待在未完成的状态。这种保持未完成的状态和心理效应（如Zeigarnik效应）能够增强记忆和动机，使得第二天工作时更容易找到状态。最后，作者建议在结束工作时，故意半途而废，以便于第二天的顺利开展。

>  **要点总结**:
>  1. 开始和结束工作方式对工作效率有重要影响。
>  2. “海明威技巧”通过未完成的状态帮助保持工作动能。
>  3. Zeigarnik效应表明未完成的任务更容易被记住。
>  4. 在每天结束时故意半途而废可以促进第二天的顺利开始。
>  5. 专家经验分享为提高写作和深度思考提供了实用策略。

Some days, it can feel really hard to start work, especially work that requires deep, focused thinking. I had many moments while writing my latest book where I had a daily writing target to achieve but would instead sit staring at a flashing cursor for 20 minutes before something useful came out of my brain (although on some mornings, “useful” might be overstating things). All I wanted on these days was to get into flow and write, but my brain had other ideas.

Rachel Botsman, a world-renowned expert on trust and technology and the first-ever Trust Fellow at Oxford University, used to love the 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. slot for her writing. She found she could do more work in those three hours than she could achieve during the rest of the day. But when she had kids, that slot disappeared.

While trying to find a new groove for her work having started a family, she discovered that one of the tricks to getting into flow was how she settled herself into work for the day. “How you start is really key to the rest of the day,” Botsman explains.

> “A really easy trick I learned is: if you’re in flow the day before, don’t finish that paragraph. Get halfway through the paragraph, and then stop. Write the next sentence the following day because it makes it really easy to pick up. Days where you’ve completed something, and you’re starting again, they’re harder because you’re starting the engine from scratch.”

Organizational psychologist and Wharton professor Adam Grant uses a similar strategy. He refers to it as parking on a downhill slope, given the ease that this act brings to getting back into flow the following day.

Some people call this idea the Hemingway Trick. Writer Ernest Hemingway once said, “When you are going good, stop writing.” Indeed, he was purported to have stopped each day’s writing session halfway through a sentence. Author Roald Dahl also used the same strategy to avoid the terrifying blank page confronting him in his morning writing sessions.

Not only does finishing halfway through a task give us momentum, it has the added benefit of keeping the information in our brain. Psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik ran [a famous experiment](https://www.psychologistworld.com/memory/zeigarnik-effect-interruptions-memory) in 1927 in which she observed that waiters were better able to remember complex orders when the order was interrupted or incomplete. However, as soon as the order was finished, it faded from memory more quickly. Known as the Zeigarnik Effect, this research demonstrates that our brain hates unfinished business, so much so that it will hold onto the information until it gets closure.

In the case of the Hemingway Trick, our brain continues to think about the unfinished task and when we come back to it, our brain is primed to easily pick up where it left off.

## Put it into action

When you are finishing work for the day, resist the temptation to reach a natural conclusion before clocking off. Instead, deliberately finish halfway through a sentence, a slide, a line of code, or whatever the type of work you are doing. By finishing halfway through, you’ll find it far easier to get started the following day and have a much more time-wise morning.
