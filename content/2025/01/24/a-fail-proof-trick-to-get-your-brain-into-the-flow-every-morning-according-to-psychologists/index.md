> **摘要**:
>  本文探讨了如何通过调整工作结束时的方式来提高第二天工作的效率。作者提到，著名信任与技术专家Rachel Botsman分享了她如何在成为母亲后调整工作节奏的经验，强调“开始的方法对整天的工作非常重要”。她建议在完成工作时，不要结束在一个完整的段落，而是中途停下来，以便第二天轻松接入。类似的策略也被组织心理学家Adam Grant采用，并称之为“停车在下坡”。这一方法与海明威的写作技巧相似，当文思泉涌时停止写作便于第二天的继续。此外，心理学家Bluma Zeigarnik的研究表明，未完成的任务更能记住，因为大脑倾向于对未完成的事务保持关注，帮助我们更快进入“流状态”。作者最终提出，建议在每天工作结束时故意在任务中途停下，以增加第二天工作的顺畅度。

>  **要点总结**:
>  1. 调整工作结束时的策略能提高第二天的工作效率。
>  2. Rachel Botsman建议中途停顿以易于第二天接入工作。
>  3. Adam Grant和海明威也采用类似的写作技巧。
>  4. Zeigarnik效应显示未完成的任务容易被记住，帮助我们准备下一次的工作。
>  5. 故意在工作中途停下可提升工作连续性与效率。

Some days, it can feel really hard to start work, especially work that requires deep, focused thinking. I had many moments while writing my latest book where I had a daily writing target to achieve but would instead sit staring at a flashing cursor for 20 minutes before something useful came out of my brain (although on some mornings, “useful” might be overstating things). All I wanted on these days was to get into flow and write, but my brain had other ideas.

Rachel Botsman, a world-renowned expert on trust and technology and the first-ever Trust Fellow at Oxford University, used to love the 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. slot for her writing. She found she could do more work in those three hours than she could achieve during the rest of the day. But when she had kids, that slot disappeared.

While trying to find a new groove for her work having started a family, she discovered that one of the tricks to getting into flow was how she settled herself into work for the day. “How you start is really key to the rest of the day,” Botsman explains.

> “A really easy trick I learned is: if you’re in flow the day before, don’t finish that paragraph. Get halfway through the paragraph, and then stop. Write the next sentence the following day because it makes it really easy to pick up. Days where you’ve completed something, and you’re starting again, they’re harder because you’re starting the engine from scratch.”

Organizational psychologist and Wharton professor Adam Grant uses a similar strategy. He refers to it as parking on a downhill slope, given the ease that this act brings to getting back into flow the following day.

Some people call this idea the Hemingway Trick. Writer Ernest Hemingway once said, “When you are going good, stop writing.” Indeed, he was purported to have stopped each day’s writing session halfway through a sentence. Author Roald Dahl also used the same strategy to avoid the terrifying blank page confronting him in his morning writing sessions.

Not only does finishing halfway through a task give us momentum, it has the added benefit of keeping the information in our brain. Psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik ran [a famous experiment](https://www.psychologistworld.com/memory/zeigarnik-effect-interruptions-memory) in 1927 in which she observed that waiters were better able to remember complex orders when the order was interrupted or incomplete. However, as soon as the order was finished, it faded from memory more quickly. Known as the Zeigarnik Effect, this research demonstrates that our brain hates unfinished business, so much so that it will hold onto the information until it gets closure.

In the case of the Hemingway Trick, our brain continues to think about the unfinished task and when we come back to it, our brain is primed to easily pick up where it left off.

## Put it into action

When you are finishing work for the day, resist the temptation to reach a natural conclusion before clocking off. Instead, deliberately finish halfway through a sentence, a slide, a line of code, or whatever the type of work you are doing. By finishing halfway through, you’ll find it far easier to get started the following day and have a much more time-wise morning.
