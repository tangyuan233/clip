> **摘要**:
>  本文探讨了如何更有效地启动工作，特别是在需要深度思考的任务中。作者提到自己在写作时常常面临启动困难，引用了信任和技术专家Rachel Botsman的观点，她发现如何开始工作对整体工作效率至关重要。Botsman的技巧是，在结束工作时不要完成任务，而是留下一部分未完成的内容，以便第二天更容易继续。这一策略也被心理学家亚当·格兰特和著名作家海明威提及，称之为“海明威技巧”。研究显示，这样做不仅可以保持思维流畅，还能利用心理学中的“齐格尼克效应”，使大脑更容易恢复未完成的任务，从而有效地提高工作效率。最后，作者建议，在结束一天的工作时故意留下未完成的内容，从而使第二天的开始更顺利。

>  **要点总结**:
>  1. 启动工作的方式直接影响到整天的工作效率。
>  2. 留下未完成的任务可以帮助更轻松地进入工作状态。
>  3. 这一策略被称为“海明威技巧”，能够延续思维的流畅性。
>  4. 心理学研究表明，大脑倾向于记住未完成的事项。
>  5. 建议在结束工作时故意不完成任务，以利于第二天的工作启动。

Some days, it can feel really hard to start work, especially work that requires deep, focused thinking. I had many moments while writing my latest book where I had a daily writing target to achieve but would instead sit staring at a flashing cursor for 20 minutes before something useful came out of my brain (although on some mornings, “useful” might be overstating things). All I wanted on these days was to get into flow and write, but my brain had other ideas.

Rachel Botsman, a world-renowned expert on trust and technology and the first-ever Trust Fellow at Oxford University, used to love the 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. slot for her writing. She found she could do more work in those three hours than she could achieve during the rest of the day. But when she had kids, that slot disappeared.

While trying to find a new groove for her work having started a family, she discovered that one of the tricks to getting into flow was how she settled herself into work for the day. “How you start is really key to the rest of the day,” Botsman explains.

> “A really easy trick I learned is: if you’re in flow the day before, don’t finish that paragraph. Get halfway through the paragraph, and then stop. Write the next sentence the following day because it makes it really easy to pick up. Days where you’ve completed something, and you’re starting again, they’re harder because you’re starting the engine from scratch.”

Organizational psychologist and Wharton professor Adam Grant uses a similar strategy. He refers to it as parking on a downhill slope, given the ease that this act brings to getting back into flow the following day.

Some people call this idea the Hemingway Trick. Writer Ernest Hemingway once said, “When you are going good, stop writing.” Indeed, he was purported to have stopped each day’s writing session halfway through a sentence. Author Roald Dahl also used the same strategy to avoid the terrifying blank page confronting him in his morning writing sessions.

Not only does finishing halfway through a task give us momentum, it has the added benefit of keeping the information in our brain. Psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik ran [a famous experiment](https://www.psychologistworld.com/memory/zeigarnik-effect-interruptions-memory) in 1927 in which she observed that waiters were better able to remember complex orders when the order was interrupted or incomplete. However, as soon as the order was finished, it faded from memory more quickly. Known as the Zeigarnik Effect, this research demonstrates that our brain hates unfinished business, so much so that it will hold onto the information until it gets closure.

In the case of the Hemingway Trick, our brain continues to think about the unfinished task and when we come back to it, our brain is primed to easily pick up where it left off.

## Put it into action

When you are finishing work for the day, resist the temptation to reach a natural conclusion before clocking off. Instead, deliberately finish halfway through a sentence, a slide, a line of code, or whatever the type of work you are doing. By finishing halfway through, you’ll find it far easier to get started the following day and have a much more time-wise morning.
