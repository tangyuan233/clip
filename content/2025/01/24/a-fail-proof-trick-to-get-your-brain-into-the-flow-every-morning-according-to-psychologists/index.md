> **摘要**:  
>  文章探讨了如何通过“海明威技巧”来提高工作效率，尤其是在需要深度思考的任务中。作者分享了自己在写作时遇到的困难，并引用了多位专家和作家的经验，说明在任务中途停止工作可以帮助大脑保持对未完成任务的关注，从而在第二天更容易进入工作状态。心理学家Bluma Zeigarnik的研究也支持这一观点，即未完成的任务会在大脑中持续活跃，直到任务完成。文章建议，每天结束时不要完成任务，而是故意在中途停止，以便第二天更容易进入工作状态。

>  1. 作者分享了在写作时遇到的困难，尤其是在需要深度思考时难以进入工作状态。
>  2. Rachel Botsman和Adam Grant等专家建议在任务中途停止工作，以便第二天更容易进入工作状态。
>  3. 这种技巧被称为“海明威技巧”，作家海明威和Roald Dahl都曾使用过类似的方法。

Some days, it can feel really hard to start work, especially work that requires deep, focused thinking. I had many moments while writing my latest book where I had a daily writing target to achieve but would instead sit staring at a flashing cursor for 20 minutes before something useful came out of my brain (although on some mornings, “useful” might be overstating things). All I wanted on these days was to get into flow and write, but my brain had other ideas.

Rachel Botsman, a world-renowned expert on trust and technology and the first-ever Trust Fellow at Oxford University, used to love the 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. slot for her writing. She found she could do more work in those three hours than she could achieve during the rest of the day. But when she had kids, that slot disappeared.

While trying to find a new groove for her work having started a family, she discovered that one of the tricks to getting into flow was how she settled herself into work for the day. “How you start is really key to the rest of the day,” Botsman explains.

> “A really easy trick I learned is: if you’re in flow the day before, don’t finish that paragraph. Get halfway through the paragraph, and then stop. Write the next sentence the following day because it makes it really easy to pick up. Days where you’ve completed something, and you’re starting again, they’re harder because you’re starting the engine from scratch.”

Organizational psychologist and Wharton professor Adam Grant uses a similar strategy. He refers to it as parking on a downhill slope, given the ease that this act brings to getting back into flow the following day.

Some people call this idea the Hemingway Trick. Writer Ernest Hemingway once said, “When you are going good, stop writing.” Indeed, he was purported to have stopped each day’s writing session halfway through a sentence. Author Roald Dahl also used the same strategy to avoid the terrifying blank page confronting him in his morning writing sessions.

Not only does finishing halfway through a task give us momentum, it has the added benefit of keeping the information in our brain. Psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik ran [a famous experiment](https://www.psychologistworld.com/memory/zeigarnik-effect-interruptions-memory) in 1927 in which she observed that waiters were better able to remember complex orders when the order was interrupted or incomplete. However, as soon as the order was finished, it faded from memory more quickly. Known as the Zeigarnik Effect, this research demonstrates that our brain hates unfinished business, so much so that it will hold onto the information until it gets closure.

In the case of the Hemingway Trick, our brain continues to think about the unfinished task and when we come back to it, our brain is primed to easily pick up where it left off.

## Put it into action

When you are finishing work for the day, resist the temptation to reach a natural conclusion before clocking off. Instead, deliberately finish halfway through a sentence, a slide, a line of code, or whatever the type of work you are doing. By finishing halfway through, you’ll find it far easier to get started the following day and have a much more time-wise morning.
