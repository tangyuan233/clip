> **摘要**:
>  本指南旨在帮助人们澄清思维，弄明白他们真正想法的原因，以及如何有效地与他人分享这些见解。作者指出，理解和交流自己的想法并不容易，因此提供了一个三步过程：反思信念背后的原因、揭示推理的假设以及承认自己的知识盲点。在此过程中，作者强调暂停自我审视的重要性，以便能够理性分析思维的复杂性和矛盾。此外，沟通是建立理解与解决分歧的重要方式，应平等而尊重地参与交流。文章呼吁人们关注自己思维过程中的假设，从而引导更有意义的对话和自我反省，最终实现更加清晰的思维。
> 
>  **要点总结**:
>  1. 寻求思维清晰有利于个人成长，有助于更好地理解自己和他人。
>  2. 通过反思信念的原因及其背后的假设，来系统性地重建推理。
>  3. 自我暂停与观察是开启澄清思维过程的基础。
>  4. 与他人进行建设性对话时，应以开放的心态理解别人的观点，认识到自身的局限。
>  5. 诚实面对自身的不确定性，有助于提高沟通的有效性与深度。

## Need to know  需要了解

Sometimes, when I’m grappling with a tricky topic, I pretend that I need to explain it to a child. For example, here is my attempt at explaining the purpose of this Guide to a notional nine-year-old:  
有时，当我遇到一个棘手的话题时，我会假装需要向一个孩子解释它。例如，这是我尝试向一个假想的九岁孩子解释本指南目的的尝试：

> I want to help people work out what they really think and mean, and then to share the results with other people. This is surprisingly hard. It’s easy to talk about what you want and like. But it can be really difficult to work out *why* you want or like particular things – and why other people should pay attention. I’m going to set out a three-part process that can help with this.  
> 我想帮助人们弄清楚他们真正想什么、意味着什么，然后与其他人分享这些结果。这出奇地困难。谈论你想要和喜欢的东西很容易。但弄清楚为什么你想要或喜欢某些特定事物——以及为什么其他人应该关注——可能真的很难。我将概述一个三步法过程，以帮助解决这个问题。

As the parent of two young children, I often get to skip the pretending part of this exercise. But I’d recommend giving it a try, no matter what your domestic situation. It can be both challenging and powerful to talk someone else through an idea, step by step, in terms that take as little as possible for granted. Often, it’s only when I try to explain something in this way that I discover that I don’t fully understand it myself.  
作为两个小孩的父亲，我经常能跳过这个练习的假装部分。但我还是建议你试一试，无论你的家庭状况如何。通过一步步地用尽可能少的假设来解释一个想法，对别人来说既具有挑战性又具有力量。通常，只有当我尝试以这种方式解释某事时，我才会发现自己并不完全理解它。

As it happens, there’s a subreddit devoted to precisely this principle. It’s called ‘Explain Like I’m Five’, and features tens of thousands of attempts at explaining complex ideas as simply as possible. Question: how can archaeologists translate ancient scriptures or languages? Answer: ‘It’s basically a giant jigsaw puzzle.’ Q: how do conferencing programmes such as Zoom handle so many different screens? A: ‘Everyone has one connection to Zoom’s central servers.’ Q: if carbs are sugar, why can’t we just eat sugar? A: ‘It would be a bit like replacing the firewood in your fire pit with a tub of gasoline …’ And so on.  
正如所发生的那样，有一个 subreddit 专注于这个原则。它被称为“Explain Like I’m Five”，展示了成千上万次尽可能简单解释复杂想法的尝试。问题：考古学家如何翻译古代经文或语言？答案：“基本上就像一个巨大的拼图。”问：像 Zoom 这样的会议程序如何处理这么多不同的屏幕？答：“每个人都与 Zoom 的中心服务器有一个连接。”问：如果碳水化合物是糖，为什么我们不能只吃糖？答：“这就像用一桶汽油替换你火坑里的木材……等等。”

I enjoy browsing ‘Explain Like I’m Five’ partly because it isn’t interested in perfection. Instead, it’s packed with comments, debates and works-in-progress; with points and counterpoints, gags and squibs. Much like the business of explaining something to an actual five-year-old, it’s full of distractions and dead ends. But it’s also relentlessly committed to dispelling errors and unexamined assumptions; and in privileging honest questions and confessions of uncertainty over any performance of expertise.  
我喜欢浏览“像五岁孩子一样解释”，部分原因是因为它并不追求完美。相反，它充满了评论、辩论和正在进行中的作品；有观点和反观点、笑话和讽刺。就像向一个真正的五岁孩子解释某事一样，它充满了分心和死胡同。但同时也坚持不懈地致力于消除错误和未经检验的假设；并且更重视诚实的问题和不确定性的坦白，而不是任何专家的表现。

All of this emphasises a fundamental point about clarifying your thinking. It asks you to admit your thoughts are *unclear* to begin with – and thus, that certain elements within them need to be *rethought*, or placed upon more secure foundations. It’s as if you’re shedding layers of preconception, misconception and false consciousness. And the ultimate prize isn’t being right, gratifying though this might be. It’s being understood.  
所有这些都强调了明确思考的基本要点。它要求你承认你的想法一开始就不清晰——因此，其中的某些元素需要重新思考，或者建立在更稳固的基础上。这就像你正在剥去先入为主的观念、误解和错误意识的外壳。而最终的奖赏并不是正确，尽管这可能会令人感到满足。而是被理解。

Why should anyone care about any of this? Without wishing to be grandiose, I’d argue that seeking clarity is both humane and life-enhancing. To idealise, it entails the mutual and respectful pursuit of knowledge. To be more pragmatic, it can help us know ourselves a little better, dispel prejudices and misapprehensions – and communicate more richly and persuasively amid the 21st century’s tumult.  
为什么有人会关心这些？无意夸大其词，我认为追求清晰既有人性，又有利于生活。理想化地说，它意味着相互尊重地追求知识。更实际一点，它可以帮助我们更好地了解自己，消除偏见和误解——在 21 世纪的动荡中，更丰富、更有说服力地沟通。

Aspiring towards clarity is also inexorably *iterative*. Whenever you set out to clarify your thinking, you’re not aiming to articulate an ultimate truth. Rather, you’re aiming at a *process,* the result of which will always be an act of *communication*, complete with all the imperfections and contingencies this implies.  
追求清晰性也是不可避免地迭代的。每当你着手澄清你的思考时，你并不是旨在表达一个终极真理。相反，你是在追求一个过程，其结果将始终是沟通的行为，包括所有由此产生的缺陷和不确定性。

In this Guide, I want to help you think about what this process looks like for you. As promised, I’ll do this in three stages (preceded by a pause). The first stage entails reflecting on *why* you believe something to be true or important. The second entails teasing out the *assumptions* this reasoning relies upon. The third entails acknowledging what you do and don’t know, where you’re *uncertain­* – and what it might mean to redress these things.  
在这个指南中，我想帮助你思考这个过程对你来说是什么样的。正如承诺的那样，我将分三个阶段进行（每个阶段之前会有停顿）。第一阶段是反思你为什么认为某事是真实的或重要的。第二阶段是揭示这种推理所依赖的假设。第三阶段是承认你所知道的和不知道的，你不确定的地方——以及纠正这些事情可能意味着什么。

## Think it through  仔细思考

**Take a breath  深呼吸**

To start with, let’s take a moment. Draw a breath. Slow yourself down. What’s going on? What are you thinking and feeling? What most deserves your attention? There’s a great line in Robert Poynton’s [book](https://thedobook.co/products/do-pause-you-are-not-a-to-do-list) *Do Pause* (2019) that speaks to the significance of taking stock in this way:  
首先，让我们花点时间。深呼吸。放慢节奏。发生了什么？你在想什么，感受什么？什么最值得你关注？在罗伯特·波顿的《暂停》（2019 年）一书中，有一句名言，谈到了以这种方式审视自己的重要性：

> In a pause you can question existing ways of acting, have new ideas or simply appreciate the life you are living. Without ever stopping to observe yourself, how can you explore what else you might do or who you might become?  
> 在暂停中，你可以质疑现有的行为方式，产生新想法，或者简单地欣赏你正在过的生活。如果不停止观察自己，你如何探索你可能会做什么，或者你可能会成为什么样的人呢？

Inviting people to pause is among the easiest advice in the world to give, and the hardest to take. Yet it’s foundational to clarifying your thinking, because this is where it all begins: with a moment of self-reflection. Without pauses, there can be no second thoughts and no self-interrogations. There is no process until you take the time to embark upon it.  
邀请人们停下来是世界上最容易给出的建议之一，但也是最难以实践的。然而，这对于澄清你的思维是基础性的，因为一切从这里开始：一个自我反思的时刻。没有暂停，就没有第二次思考，也没有自我质疑。除非你花时间去开始这个过程，否则就没有这个过程。

You might think that this point is too obvious to be worth making. Yet, in my experience, it’s where most of us fall down. We all carry around countless unclear, confused, contradictory thoughts and feelings. And precisely because we have neither the time nor the tools to sort them out, they mostly stay this way.  
你可能认为这个观点太明显了，不值得提。然而，根据我的经验，这正是我们大多数人容易出错的地方。我们每个人都带着无数不清楚、混乱、矛盾的想法和感受。正是因为我们没有时间也没有工具去整理它们，它们大多就这样停留在这个状态。

Once you’ve paused, a common psychotherapeutic exercise can help you take a first step towards clearer thinking. It’s about observing yourself as neutrally as possible. You make yourself comfortable, relax, then try to notice the flow of your thoughts and feelings in a nonjudgmental way: the flickers of anxiety, anticipation, regret; the memories and ideas bubbling into consciousness.  
一旦暂停，一个常见的心理治疗练习可以帮助你迈出清晰思考的第一步。这关乎尽可能中立地观察自己。让自己舒适，放松，然后尝试以非评判性的方式注意到你的思想和感受的流动：焦虑的闪烁、期待、后悔；记忆和想法在意识中涌现。

These are the raw materials that any process of clarification must work with. The more carefully you’re able to attend to them, the more likely you are to tease out their complexities and contradictions. And the less likely you are to mistakenly assume that whatever seems obvious to you will necessarily seem obvious, or compelling, to someone else.  
这些是任何澄清过程必须处理的原材料。你越能仔细关注它们，就越有可能揭示它们的复杂性和矛盾。而且，你不太可能错误地假设对你来说显而易见的事情对别人来说也必然是显而易见或令人信服的。

**Reflect on why you believe something to be true or important  
反思你为什么认为某事是真实的或重要的**

When I perform the above exercise, I notice one thing that’s on my mind is a nagging question around what I eat. Should I become a vegetarian, or a vegan, for ethical and environmental reasons? And if not, why not?  
当我进行上述练习时，我注意到一个萦绕在我心头的问题，那就是关于我吃什么。我应该为了道德和环保原因成为素食主义者，还是纯素食主义者？如果不是，那又是为什么？

In philosophy, what’s known as *standard form* is often used to set out the essentials of a line of thought as clearly as possible. Expressing your thinking in standard form means writing out a numbered list of statements followed by a conclusion. If you’ve done it properly, the numbered statements should present a line of reasoning that justifies your final conclusion. For example, here’s a first attempt at organising my thoughts around diet:  
在哲学中，所谓的标准形式通常被用来尽可能清晰地阐述一条思维路线的要点。用标准形式表达你的思考意味着列出一系列陈述，然后得出结论。如果你做得恰当，这些编号的陈述应该展示出一串推理，以证明你的最终结论。例如，这是我对饮食思考的组织尝试：

1. Both eating meat and using animal products are associated with vast amounts of unnecessary animal suffering.  
食用肉类和使用动物产品都与大量不必要的动物痛苦相关。
2. They also use more energy and resources than most plant-based alternatives.  
他们也比大多数植物性替代品消耗更多的能源和资源。
3. It’s perfectly possible to have a healthy diet and live a full life without eating meat or using most animal products.  
完全有可能在不吃肉或不使用大多数动物产品的情况下，拥有健康饮食和充实的生活。
4. So far as possible, I should try to prevent unnecessary animal suffering, excessive energy usage and the overconsumption of resources.  
尽可能减少不必要的动物痛苦、过度能源消耗和资源过度消费。

*If I believe all of the above to be true, I should thus adopt a vegetarian or a vegan diet.  
如果我相信上述所有内容都是真实的，那么我应该因此采用素食或纯素食饮食。*

You might have seen examples of this approach before, or used it in your own work. You might also have encountered a great deal of discussion around logical forms, reasonable and unreasonable justifications, and so on. What I find most useful about standard form, however, is not so much its promise of logical rigour as its insistence that I break down my thinking into individual steps, and then ask two questions of each one:  
您可能之前见过这种方法的例子，或者在自己的工作中使用过。您也可能遇到过大量关于逻辑形式、合理与不合理论证的讨论。然而，我认为标准形式最有用的地方，与其说是它对逻辑严谨性的承诺，不如说是它坚持让我将我的思考分解成一个个步骤，然后对每一个步骤提出两个问题：

- *Why* should a reasonable person accept this particular claim?  
为什么一个理智的人会接受这个特定的主张？
- *What* follows from this claim, once it’s been accepted?  
接下来从这个主张被接受后，会得出什么结论？

When it comes to clarifying my thoughts and feelings, the power of such an approach is that anything relevant can potentially be integrated into its accounting – but only if I’m able to make this relevance explicit. Here’s how a few further thoughts might fit into my example:  
当涉及到澄清我的思想和感受时，这种方法的威力在于任何相关的内容都有可能被整合到其核算中——但前提是我能够明确这种相关性。以下是一些进一步的想法如何融入我的例子中：

1. Both eating meat and using animal products are associated with vast amounts of unnecessary animal suffering.  
食用肉类和使用动物产品都与大量不必要的动物痛苦相关。
2. They also use more energy and resources than most plant-based alternatives.  
他们也比大多数植物性替代品消耗更多的能源和资源。
3. It’s perfectly possible to have a healthy diet and live a full life without eating meat or using most animal products.  
完全有可能在不吃肉或不使用大多数动物产品的情况下，拥有健康饮食和充实的生活。
4. So far as possible, I should try to prevent unnecessary animal suffering, excessive energy usage and the overconsumption of resources.  
尽可能减少不必要的动物痛苦、过度能源消耗和资源过度消费。
5. If I believe all of the above to be true, I should thus adopt a vegetarian or a vegan diet.  
如果我相信上述所有内容都是真实的，那么我应该因此采用素食或纯素食饮食。
6. However, I’m not currently a vegetarian or a vegan.  
然而，我目前既不是素食主义者，也不是纯素食者。
7. This suggests that either: I don’t believe the above reasons to be true, or to be the whole story; or that I do, yet somehow still don’t find them compelling.  
这表明可能是以下两种情况之一：我不相信上述理由是真实的，或者这只是整个故事的一部分；或者我相信，但不知为何仍然觉得它们没有说服力。

*If I want to clarify my thinking around this issue, I need to investigate the divide between my apparent beliefs and my actions.  
如果我想澄清我对这个问题的思考，我需要调查我表面信念与行动之间的分歧。*

How might you apply such an approach yourself? As you’ll have noticed, the thoughts I’ve just added bring further complexities and qualifications into focus. They take what was once a relatively straightforward conclusion and turn it into something more complex – and revealing.  
如何将这种方法应用于自己？正如你所注意到的，我刚刚添加的想法进一步聚焦了复杂性和限制。它们将曾经相对直接的结论转变为更复杂——并且更有揭示性的东西。

Paradoxically enough, this is a vital component of clarifying your thinking: stripping away oversimplifications, no matter how compelling or appealing, and replacing them with an honest acknowledgment of circumstances. The logic of my initial argument might have seemed admirably clear; but this clarity doesn’t correspond as closely as I might wish to reality.  
矛盾的是，这是澄清你思维的一个关键组成部分：剥离任何看似有说服力或吸引力的过度简化，并用对环境的诚实承认来替代。我最初论点的逻辑可能看起来令人钦佩地清晰；但这种清晰度并不像我可能希望的那样与现实紧密对应。

Honest self-examination and iteration are vital, here. Even now, reading back my own words, I’m not sure I’ve managed to describe my state of mind accurately – or the issues at stake. Is it really true that there’s no ethical way of eating meat or of using animal products? Are there shades of meaning I’ve neglected in an effort to establish clear categories of right and wrong? Or am I simply failing to act on my beliefs because of a combination of inertia and self-indulgence?  
诚实自我反省和迭代至关重要。即便现在，回读自己的文字，我都不确定是否准确描述了我的心态——或涉及的议题。真的存在一种道德上无法接受吃肉或使用动物产品的方式吗？在努力建立对错清晰分类的过程中，我是否忽略了某些含义的细微差别？或者，我只是因为惰性和自我放纵而未能付诸行动？

These are just a few of the questions my scenario begs. And behind them is a fundamental point: that it’s only by repeatedly questioning both the *why* and the *what* of our claims, and the claims they in turn rely on, that we can hope to strip away the layers of habit, confusion and self-justification that all too often typify everyday thoughts.  
这些只是我的场景引发的一些问题。而背后有一个基本观点：只有通过反复质疑我们主张的“为什么”和“是什么”，以及它们所依赖的主张，我们才有可能剥去那些过于常见于日常思维的习性、困惑和自我辩解的层层面纱。

**Ask yourself what you have taken for granted  
问问自己，你有什么是视为理所当然的**

Upon what basis can I justify any claims? Some will rely on external evidence; some on personal preferences and experiences; some on a combination of these factors. But all of them will at some point invoke certain *assumptions* that I’m prepared to accept as fundamental. And it’s in unearthing and analysing these assumptions that the most important clarifications await.  
基于什么依据我可以证明任何主张？有些人会依赖外部证据；有些人会依赖个人喜好和经验；有些人会依赖这些因素的组合。但它们最终都会涉及到某些我准备接受为基本假设的假设。而最重要的澄清就在于挖掘和分析这些假设之中。

Assumptions are those things we take for granted: whatever we don’t explicitly spell out, but that our thinking relies upon. Assumptions are also extremely important. Indeed, it’s the existence of shared assumptions that makes communication (and much else) possible. As I write these words, I’m assuming they mean approximately the same thing to you as they do to me. It would be incredibly tiresome if I tried to explain every word in a sentence. It would also, in the end, be futile. I’d still have to explain my words via other words, my ideas via other ideas, and so on. Without some shared assumptions, there would be no way of building either common understandings or meaningful disagreements.  
假设是我们认为理所当然的事情：我们未明确表述，但我们的思考依赖于它们。假设也非常重要。的确，正是共享的假设使得沟通（以及许多其他事情）成为可能。当我写下这些话时，我假设它们对你来说和我一样意味着大致相同的东西。如果我试图解释句子中的每一个词，那将极其乏味。最终，这也会是徒劳的。我仍然必须通过其他词语来解释我的话，通过其他想法来解释我的观点，等等。如果没有一些共享的假设，就无法建立共同的理解或有意义的分歧。

While common understanding and meaningful disagreement might sound like opposites, they’re actually two sides of the same coin. No matter how self-evident they might seem to us, the assumptions that our ideas rest upon might need spelling out to others. Some people could, for example, view animal suffering as a non-issue, on the grounds that human experience is all that counts when it comes to ethics. Some could believe that no further justification of veganism is required beyond the self-evident evil of inflicting unnecessary suffering on our fellow creatures. And some (among whom I tentatively count myself) might believe that most forms of industrial farming and fishing are abhorrent, but that there are some circumstances under which animal products can be ethically and sustainably sourced.  
虽然常识和有意义的分歧听起来像是相反的，但实际上它们是同一枚硬币的两面。无论它们在我们看来可能多么显而易见，我们理念所依赖的假设可能需要向他人阐明。例如，有些人可能会认为动物痛苦不是一个问题，理由是当涉及到道德时，人类经验才是唯一重要的。有些人可能会认为，除了显而易见的对同类施加不必要的痛苦的邪恶之外，无需进一步证明素食主义的合理性。还有一些人（我暂且把自己算在内）可能会认为，大多数形式的工业农业和渔业是令人厌恶的，但在某些情况下，动物产品可以在道德和可持续的方式下获得。

Our assumptions, in other words, aren’t just unexamined ideas. They’re also the roots of identity and allegiance; the stuff of our personal and shared histories; of our communities and our morality. They are the sources of much of the greatest good and deepest harm we do to one another. That which we take as ‘given’ is nothing less than the bedrock of what we believe the world to be.  
我们的假设，换句话说，不仅仅是未经检验的想法。它们也是身份和忠诚的根源；是我们个人和共同历史的素材；是我们社区和我们的道德。它们是我们彼此造成的大部分最大善和最深伤害的来源。我们视为“既定”的东西，正是我们相信的世界的基础。

What follow from this? When it comes to clarifying your thinking, it means that you need to be very clear about the difference between *what follows from your assumptions* and *the status of those assumptions*. To take things step by step:  
接下来是什么？当涉及到澄清你的思考时，这意味着你需要非常清楚地区分从你的假设中得出的结论以及这些假设的现状。逐步进行：

- Any line of thought must begin with certain assumptions: those things that you both explicitly and implicitly accept as *given*. No matter how deep you dig, you’ll never be able to find a wholly clear, self-evident and uncontroversial claim.  
任何思考的线条都必须从某些假设开始：那些你既明确又隐含地接受为既定的事实。无论你挖掘得多深，你永远无法找到一个完全清晰、不言而喻且无争议的论断。
- A careful process of analysis can show where your assumptions lead: what reasonably follows from them, if you assume that they’re true or accurate.  
一个仔细的分析过程可以显示出你的假设会导致什么：如果你假设它们是真实或准确的，那么从它们中合理地可以得出什么。
- But different lines of reasoning based on different sets of assumptions are likely to take you in very different directions.  
但是，基于不同假设集的不同推理路线可能会将你引向非常不同的方向。
- One of the most useful things you can thus do is to spell out both your own and other people’s key assumptions, then to compare what follows from each.  
你可以做的一件非常有用的事情就是明确阐述自己和他人关键假设的内容，然后比较由此产生的不同结果。
- If you’re sufficiently open-minded, this can help you identify assumptions you hold in common with others, challenge faulty ones on both sides, and respectfully engage with alternative perspectives from your own.  
如果你足够开放心态，这可以帮助你识别自己与他人共有的假设，挑战双方的错误假设，并尊重地与不同的观点进行交流。

Working out the implications of your assumptions is, in other words, far from the same thing as being definitively correct; and grasping the difference between these lies at the heart of honestly and persuasively articulating your views.  
推敲你假设的含义，换句话说，与绝对正确大相径庭；而把握这两者之间的区别，正是坦诚且有说服力地表达你观点的核心。

**Embrace dialogue – and know your limits  
拥抱对话——了解你的界限**

What do you make of my attempts to clarify my thinking about meat-eating, thus far? Hopefully, even if you disagree with every single word I’ve written, you’re more likely to understand where I’m coming from than if I just blurted out: ‘I think that maybe I ought to stop eating meat.’ I certainly feel more confident about what’s going on in my head. And this suggests that, if we ever end up discussing these things in person, we’re more likely to be able to debate our differences constructively. We’ll perhaps be able to work out where we do and don’t disagree – and why – rather than falling back upon blanket assertions or aspersions. In the end, we might even arrive at a new, clearer understanding together.  
你如何看待我迄今为止试图阐明我对吃肉的思考？希望即使你不同意我写的每一个字，你也能更理解我的出发点，而不是我直接说出：“我觉得我可能应该停止吃肉。”我确实对自己的想法更有信心。这表明，如果我们最终面对面讨论这些事情，我们更有可能建设性地辩论我们的分歧。我们可能会弄清楚我们在哪里不同意，以及为什么——而不是退回到笼统的断言或诽谤。最终，我们甚至可能一起达到一个新的、更清晰的理解。

This, I’d suggest, is the most precious thing about clearly presenting the thinking behind any point of view: not that it proves your rightness or righteousness, but that it volunteers your willingness to participate in a reasoned exchange of ideas. At least in principle, it suggests that you’re prepared to:  
这，我建议，是清晰表达任何观点背后的思考最宝贵的地方：并不是因为它证明了你的正确性或正义性，而是它自愿表明你愿意参与一个有理有据的思想交流。至少在原则上，它表明你准备：

- Justify your position via evidence and reasoned analysis.  
用证据和合理的分析来证明你的立场。
- Listen to, and learn from, perspectives other than your own.  
倾听并从不同于你自己的视角中学习。
- Accept that, in the face of sufficiently compelling arguments or evidence, it might be reasonable to change your mind.  
接受，面对足够有说服力的论点或证据，改变你的想法可能是合理的。

This approach is underpinned by what’s known as the *principle of charity*: a phrase that can sound strange in the context of disagreements, but that embodies one of our oldest and most practical guides to constructive debate. It exists in various formulations, all rooted in the same idea:  
这种方法基于所谓的“宽容原则”：一个在争论的语境中可能听起来有些奇怪的短语，但它体现了我们最古老、最实用的建设性辩论指南之一。它以各种形式存在，都根植于同一个理念：

> So far as possible, you should try to extract the maximum truthful and reasonable content from what others say, especially if they disagree with you.  
> 尽可能从他人所言中提取最大限度的真实和合理内容，尤其是当他们与你意见相左时。

Importantly, the principle of charity extends not only to *what* someone is saying, but also to your assumptions around *why* they are saying it:  
重要的是，慈善原则不仅适用于某人所说的话，还适用于你对为什么他们这么说这一假设的理解：

> Unless you have decisive evidence to the contrary, you should start off by assuming that someone else’s position is reasonable and sincerely held, rather than that they’re malicious, ignorant or mistaken.  
> 除非你有决定性的相反证据，否则你应该首先假设别人的立场是合理的且真诚持有的，而不是他们是有恶意的、无知的或错误的。

Why? In both cases, the answer isn’t because this is a nice thing to do, but because it’s only by beginning with charitable assumptions that you can get to grips with the underpinnings of someone else’s perspective – and ensure that any judgment you eventually pass is based on a careful, fair-minded assessment.  
为什么？在这两种情况下，答案并不是因为这是一件好事要做，而是只有从慈善的假设开始，你才能理解别人的观点的基础——并确保你最终做出的任何判断都是基于仔细、公正的评估。

All of which brings us back to the most important point of all: that clarifying your thinking means being as honest as possible about what you don’t know, and then putting a frank engagement with these limitations at the heart of your account.  
所有这些又让我们回到了最重要的要点：澄清你的思考意味着尽可能诚实地面对你所不知道的，然后将坦率地面对这些局限性的态度作为你叙述的核心。

Indeed, perhaps the most important tool in any attempt at clear thinking is the capacity to test (and to keep on testing and refining) your ideas as if they belonged to someone else: as acts of reasoned persuasion that must stand, or fall, on their own terms.  
确实，在尝试清晰思考的过程中，最重要的工具可能是测试（并且持续测试和改进）你自己的想法，仿佛它们属于另一个人：作为必须独立站立或倒下的理性说服行为。

### Key points – How to think clearly  
关键点 - 如何清晰思考

1. **Seeking clarity of thought is humane and life-enhancing.** It can help you know yourself a little better, dispel prejudices and misapprehensions, and communicate more richly and persuasively.  
寻求思维清晰是人性化的，有益于生活。它能帮助你更好地了解自己，消除偏见和误解，以及更丰富、更有说服力地沟通。
2. **Take a breath.** It’s only by slowing down and attending carefully to your own thoughts that you can hope to embark upon a process of clarification.  
深呼吸。只有放慢速度，仔细关注自己的思绪，你才能开始一个澄清的过程。
3. **Reflect on why you believe something to be true or important.** This entails *reconstructing* your reasoning systematically. Set it out in a numbered sequence of statements or claims that lead up to your conclusion. Be sure to ask of each claim: *why* should a reasonable person accept this; and *what* does (and doesn’t) follow once it’s been accepted?  
反思你为什么认为某事是真实的或重要的。这涉及到系统地重建你的推理。用一系列编号的陈述或论点来阐述你的结论。确保对每个论点提问：一个合理的人为什么应该接受这个论点；一旦被接受，它将（或不）导致什么？
4. **Ask yourself what you have taken for granted.** The idea is to identify the basic *assumptions* that your reasoning relies on – these are the things that you don’t explicitly spell out, but that your thinking relies upon. It’s in unearthing and analysing these assumptions that the most important clarifications await.  
问问自己你习以为常的是什么。这个想法是为了确定你的推理所依赖的基本假设——这些是你没有明确说明，但你的思考所依赖的东西。最重要的澄清就在于挖掘和分析这些假设。
5. **Embrace dialogue – and know your limits.** Engage *charitably* and *rigorously* with perspectives other than your own, and don’t assume dishonesty or bad faith in others without good reason. Clarifying your thinking also means being as honest as possible about what you don’t know.  
拥抱对话——并了解你的界限。以慈善和严格的态度与不同于你自己的观点交流，在没有充分理由的情况下，不要假设他人不诚实或恶意。澄清你的思考也意味着尽可能诚实地关于你所不知道的事情。

## Why it matters  为什么这很重要

What does it mean to make the kind of process I’ve outlined above habitual – and what might it mean, for you, to apply it effectively in different areas of your life?  
将我上面概述的过程变成习惯意味着什么——对你来说，在生活的不同领域有效应用它又意味着什么？

This is the point at which your personal preferences come into play. For me, the props and routines of clear thinking include (in no particular order) strong cups of coffee, directionless neighbourhood strolls, a desk surrounded by heaped books and scrap paper, and as much serendipitous reading as I can squeeze in between school runs.  
这是你个人喜好发挥作用的时刻。对我来说，清晰思考的道具和仪式包括（不分先后）浓咖啡、漫无目的的街区漫步、被堆满书籍和废纸的办公桌，以及在学校接送途中尽可能多的偶然阅读。

For you, the twin realms of the possible and the desirable might look very different. But the same principle applies. We both need to take a close interest in the times, places, habits and contexts that bring out the best in us – and that give us permission to contemplate, then try to explain, what’s really going on when it comes to the questions that matter most.  
对你来说，可能性和期望的双重领域可能看起来非常不同。但原则是相同的。我们都需要密切关注那些能激发我们最好一面、并允许我们思考、尝试解释最重要问题真正发生情况的时间、地点、习惯和背景。

Another way of putting this is that willpower is overrated. Among all the potted insights I’ve drawn from social science, this is perhaps the handiest and most humbling. Unless you seek out contexts, routines and environments that support your best self, you’ll struggle to be that self at any but the very best of times.  
另一种说法是，意志力被高估了。在我从社会科学中汲取的众多洞见中，这或许是最实用且最谦卑的一个。除非你寻找支持你最好自己的情境、习惯和环境，否则你很难在任何非最佳时刻成为那个自己。

Aim to interrogate and audit your habits in the light of this insight. Find ways of thinking and working that *work for you*. Be as ruthless as possible about identifying the ones that don’t work, and why; and how far you can minimise the toll they take. Try to take a lively and systematic interest in your own blind spots and limitations. Be honest about what you do and don’t know, where you’re uncertain; and what kind of conversations, investigations, predictions and discoveries might reduce this uncertainty.  
旨在根据这一洞察力审视和审计你的习惯。寻找对你有效的工作和思考方式。在识别那些不起作用的方法及其原因，以及你能最大限度地减少它们带来的损失方面，尽可能无情。努力对你自己的盲点和局限性保持生动和系统的兴趣。诚实地面对你所知和不知的内容，你的不确定之处；以及哪些对话、调查、预测和发现可能会减少这种不确定性。

Above all, don’t forget to ask for help when you need it – and to offer it whenever you can. When it comes to clarity and communication alike, this is perhaps the simplest and most important thing any of us can do: keep talking to one another, and try to truly listen to what’s being said in response.  
首先，别忘了在你需要的时候寻求帮助——并且在你能够的时候提供帮助。在清晰度和沟通方面，这可能是我们所有人能做的最简单、最重要的事情：继续相互交谈，并努力真正倾听对方的回应。
