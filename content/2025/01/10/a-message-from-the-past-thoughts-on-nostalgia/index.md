> **摘要**：  
> 文章探讨了怀旧心理如何影响我们对过去的记忆和感受。作者通过个人经历和股市、房地产等经济现象，指出人们往往在回顾过去时忽略了当时的不确定性和焦虑，只记住了美好的部分。这种“后见之明”让我们误以为过去比实际更美好，而忽视了当时的真实感受。文章强调，过去并不像我们记忆中的那样完美，现在也不像我们想象的那么糟糕，未来可能会比我们预期的更好。
> 
> **要点总结**：  
> 1. 怀旧心理让我们在回顾过去时忽略了当时的不确定性和焦虑，只记住了美好的部分。  
> 2. 股市和房地产市场的历史表明，人们在知道结局后容易忘记过程中的波动和风险。  
> 3. 过去的经济危机（如2009年金融危机）在当时充满不确定性，但回顾时却被视为机会。  
> 4. 怀旧的存在部分是因为我们适应了过去的困难并继续前行，这使得我们低估了当时的挑战。  
> 5. 理解怀旧的本质有助于我们更客观地看待过去、现在和未来，认识到未来可能会比我们预期的更好。

## A Message From the Past (Thoughts on Nostalgia)  

来自过去的消息（关于怀旧）

After college, my wife (who was then my girlfriend) and I got an apartment in the Seattle suburbs. It was amazing – a perfect location, a beautiful apartment, even had a view of the lake. The economy was such a wreck at the time that we paid almost nothing for it.  

大学毕业后，我的妻子（那时是我的女友）和我租了西雅图郊区的公寓。太棒了——位置完美，公寓漂亮，甚至还能看到湖景。当时经济状况糟糕，我们几乎没花什么钱。

A few months ago I reminisced to my wife about how awesome that time was. We were 23, gainfully employed, living in our version of the Taj Mahal. This was before kids, so we slept in until 10am on the weekends, went for a walk, had brunch, took a nap, and went out for dinner. That was our life. For years.  

几个月前，我向我妻子回忆起那段时光是多么美好。那时我们 23 岁，有稳定的工作，住在我们的泰姬陵版本里。那时还没有孩子，所以周末我们睡到上午 10 点，散步，吃早午餐，小憩一会儿，然后出去吃晚餐。这就是我们的生活。多年来都是这样。

“That was peak living, as good as it gets,” I told her.  

那是最美好的生活，再好不过了，”我对她说。

“What are you talking about?” she said. “You were more anxious, scared, and probably depressed then than you’ve ever been.”  

你在说什么？她说。“那时你比任何时候都更焦虑、害怕，可能还抑郁。”

Of course, she was right.  

当然，她是对的。

If I think deeper than the initial knee-jerk memory, I remember being miserable. I was overwhelmed with career anxieties, terrified that I wouldn’t make it, worried I was about to be fired. For good reason: I was bad at my job. I was insecure. I was nervous about relationships being fragile.  

如果我比最初的直觉记忆思考得更深，我会记得自己很痛苦。我淹没在职业焦虑中，害怕自己无法成功，担心自己即将被解雇。有充分的理由：我工作做得不好。我不自信。我担心人际关系脆弱。

In my head, today, I look back and think, “I must have been so happy then. Those were my best years.” But in reality, at the time, I was thinking, “I can’t wait for these years to end.”  

在我心中，今天，我回顾过去，想，“我那时一定很快乐。那是我最好的岁月。”但在现实中，当时我却在想，“我迫不及待地想结束这些岁月。”

There’s a Russian saying about nostalgia: “The past is more unpredictable than the future.” It’s so common for people’s memories about a time to become disconnected from how they actually felt at the time.  

俄罗斯有一句关于怀旧的话：“过去比未来更不可预测。”人们常常会发现自己对某个时代的记忆与当时实际的感受脱节。

I have a theory for why this happens: When studying history, you know how the story ends, which makes it impossible to imagine what people were thinking or feeling in the past.  

我有这样一个理论：当研究历史时，你知道故事会如何结束，这使得你无法想象过去人们当时在想什么或感受什么。

When thinking about our own lives, we don’t remember how we actually felt in the past; We remember how we think we should have felt, given what we know today.  

当我们思考自己的生活时，我们并不记得我们过去实际上是如何感受的；我们记得的是，根据我们今天所知道的情况，我们认为我们应该如何感受。

I remember myself as being happier than I was because today, looking back, I know that most of the things I was worried about never happened. I didn’t get laid off, the career turned out fine, the relationships endured. I [slayed some demons](https://collabfund.com/blog/overcoming-your-demons/). Even the things that were hard and didn’t end up like I wanted, I got over.  

我记得自己比以前更快乐，因为今天回顾过去，我知道我担心的许多事情从未发生。我没有被裁员，事业很顺利，关系也持续了下来。我战胜了一些恶魔。即使那些艰难的事情最终没有按照我想要的方式结束，我也克服了。

I know that now.  

我知道了。

But I didn’t know that at the time.  

但我当时并不知道。

So when I look back, I see a kid who had nothing to worry about. Even if, at the time, all I did was worry.  

所以我回顾过去，看到一个无忧无虑的孩子。即使在当时，我所做的只是担忧。

It’s hard to remember how you felt when you know how the story ends.  

很难记得你当时的感觉，当你知道故事结局时。

I was recently asked at a conference how investors should feel about the stock market given that it’s basically gone straight up over the last 15 years.  

最近在一场会议上，有人问我投资者应该如何看待股市，鉴于过去 15 年里股市基本上是一路上涨。

My first thought was: you’re right. If you started investing 15 years ago and checked your account for the first time, you would gasp. You’ve made a fortune.  

我的第一个想法是：你说得对。如果你从 15 年前开始投资，第一次查看账户时，你会感到惊讶。你已经赚了一大笔钱。

Then I thought, wait a minute. *Straight up for the last 15 years?* To echo my wife: What are you talking about?  

然后我想，等一下。这 15 年来一直直截了当？像我妻子说的：你在说什么呢？

Are we going to pretend like the 22% crash in the summer of 2011 never happened?  

我们要假装 2011 年夏天 22%的崩盘从未发生过吗？

Are we supposed to forget that stocks plunged more than 20% in 2016, and again in 2018?  

我们是否应该忘记 2016 年和 2018 年股市暴跌超过 20%的事实？

Are we – *hello?* – now pretending that the worst economic calamity since the Great Depression didn’t happen in 2020?  

我们——你好？——现在假装 2020 年没有发生自大萧条以来最严重的经济灾难吗？

That Europe’s banking system nearly collapsed?  

欧洲的银行系统几乎崩溃？

That wages were stagnant?  

工资停滞不前？

That America’s national debt was downgraded?  

美国的国债被降级？

Are we now forgetting that at virtually every moment of the last 15 years, smart people argued that the market was overvalued, recession was near, hyperinflation was around the corner, the country was bankrupt, the numbers were manipulated, the dollar was worthless, on and on?  

我们是否现在忘记了在过去 15 年的几乎每一刻，聪明的人都在争论市场被高估，经济衰退即将来临，恶性通货膨胀即将到来，国家破产，数据被操纵，美元一文不值，如此等等？

I think we forget these things because we now know how the story ends: the stock market went up a lot. If you held on tight, none of those past events mattered. So it’s easy to discount – even ignore – how they felt at the time. You think back and say, “That was so easy, money was free, the market went straight up.” Even if few people actually felt that way during the last 15 years.  

我认为我们忘记这些事情，因为我们现在知道故事的结果：股市上涨了很多。如果你紧紧抓住，那些过去的事件都不重要。所以很容易贬低——甚至忽视——当时的感觉。你回想起来会说，“那太容易了，钱是免费的，市场直线上升。”即使在过去 15 年里，真正有这种感觉的人很少。

So much of what matters in investing – this is true for a lot of things in life – is how you manage the psychology of uncertainty. The problem with looking back with hindsight is that nothing is uncertain. You think no one had anything to worry about, because most of what they were worrying about eventually came to pass.  

投资中许多重要的事情——这在生活中很多事情上都是如此——在于你如何管理不确定性的心理。回顾过去的问题在于，没有什么是不确定的。你认为没有人需要担心，因为大多数他们担心的事情最终都发生了。

“You should have been happy and calm, given where things ended up,” you say to your past self. But your past self had no idea where things would end up. Uncertainty dictates nearly everything in the current moment, but looking back we pretend it never existed.  

“鉴于事情最终的结果，你应该感到高兴和冷静，”你对过去的自己说。但过去的你并不知道事情会发展到哪里。不确定性几乎决定了当前时刻的一切，但回顾过去，我们假装它从未存在过。

My wife and I recently bought a new house. Like most of the country, it cost – let me put this mildly – a shitload more than it would have a few years ago.  

我和妻子最近买了一栋新房。就像这个国家的大多数人一样，它的价格——让我温和地说——比几年前多了很多。

We started talking about how cheap homes were in 2009. In our region they literally cost four to five times more today than they did then – plus, interest rates were low in 2009, and there was an endless supply of homes on the market to choose from. We said something to the effect of, “People were so lucky back then.”  

2009 年我们开始谈论房价有多便宜。在我们地区，现在的房价几乎是那时的四到五倍——而且，2009 年的利率很低，市场上可供选择的房源源源不断。我们说了一些类似的话，“那时候的人真是太幸运了。”

Then we caught ourselves, shaking off delusion, and thinking, “Wait, do we really have nostalgia for the *economy of 2009*?” That was literally the worst economy in 80 years. All anyone talked about was how terrible everything was. Homes were cheap because unemployment was 10% and the stock market was down 50%.  

然后我们意识到自己正在摆脱幻想，思考着：“等等，我们真的怀念 2009 年的经济吗？”那简直是 80 年来最糟糕的经济。所有人都在谈论一切是多么糟糕。房价低廉，因为失业率达到了 10%，股市下跌了 50%。

Looking back, we know 2009 was not only the bottom but the beginning of a new boom (albeit with volatility). But we didn’t know that back then, and it gave us plenty to worry about that’s easy to forget today. What felt like risks then now look like opportunities. What felt like dangers then now look like adventures.  

回顾过去，我们知道 2009 年不仅是低谷，也是新一轮繁荣的开始（尽管伴随着波动）。但当时我们并不知道这一点，这让我们当时有很多担忧，如今却容易忘记。当时感觉像是风险的东西现在看起来像是机会。当时感觉像是危险的东西现在看起来像是冒险。

In a similar way, Americans are still nostalgic about life in the 1950s. White picket fences, middle-class prosperity, happy families, a booming economy. There was also the ever-present risk of nuclear annihilation. Today, we know the missile was never launched. But the 5th-grader doing nuclear attack drills by ducking under her school desk? She had no idea, and had plenty to worry about that is impossible to contextualize today, since we know how the story ends. So of course she wasn’t as happy as we think she should have been.  

在类似的方式中，美国人仍然怀念 20 世纪 50 年代的生活。白色的栅栏、中产阶级的繁荣、幸福的家庭、繁荣的经济。还有核毁灭的持续风险。如今，我们知道导弹从未发射。但那个在课桌下躲避核攻击演习的五年级学生？她不知道，而且有很多事情让她担心，这在今天是无法理解的，因为我们知道故事的结局。所以，当然她并不像我们认为她应该那么快乐。

I subscribe to a few Instagram accounts devoted to 1990s nostalgia. I was a kid then, so I’m a sucker for this stuff. The comments on those posts inevitably say some version of, “Those were the best years. The late ‘90s and early 2000s was the best time to be alive.” Maybe it was pretty good. But we also had: A bad recession in 2001, a contested presidential election, 9-11 – which utterly reshaped culture – two wars, a slow economic recovery, on and on. It’s easy to forget all of those because we know the economy recovered, the wars ended, and there wasn’t another major terrorist attack. Everything looks certain in hindsight, but at the time uncertainty ruled the day.  

我订阅了一些致力于 90 年代怀旧主义的 Instagram 账号。那时候我还是个孩子，所以我对这些东西情有独钟。那些帖子下的评论不可避免地会说一些版本的话，“那是最美好的年代。90 年代末和 21 世纪初是最适合活着的时候。”可能确实不错。但我们也有：2001 年的经济衰退，一场争议性的总统选举，9-11 事件——这彻底改变了文化——两场战争，缓慢的经济复苏，等等。因为我们知道经济已经恢复，战争已经结束，而且没有发生另一次重大的恐怖袭击，所以很容易忘记所有这些。但回顾过去，一切似乎都是确定的，但当时不确定性才是主导。

Of course, things could have turned out differently. And for many people – those who *were* laid off, or *did* lose their home, or *did* die in war – the happy nostalgia of remembering what life was like before might well be valid.  

当然，事情可能会有不同的结果。对于许多人来说——那些被裁员、失去家园或死于战争的人——回忆起过去的生活可能确实是一种快乐的怀旧。

But as Thomas Jefferson said, “How much pain have cost us the evils which have never happened.”  

但正如托马斯·杰斐逊所说，“我们从未发生过的恶行付出了多少痛苦。”

Part of the reason nostalgia exists is because, knowing what we do today, we often look back at the past and say, “you really didn’t have much to worry about.” You adapted and moved on. Isn’t that an important lesson as we look ahead?  

怀旧存在的一部分原因是，鉴于我们今天所知，我们常常回顾过去，说：“你当时真的没有什么可担心的。”你适应并继续前行。这不是我们展望未来时的重要教训吗？

Understanding why economic nostalgia is so powerful – why it’s almost impossible to remember how uncertain things were in the past when you know how the story ends – helps explain what I think is the most important lesson in economic history, that’s true for most people most of the time:  

理解为什么经济怀旧如此强大——为什么当你知道故事结局时，几乎不可能记住过去事情的不确定性——有助于解释我认为经济史上最重要的教训，这在大多数时候对大多数人来说都是真的：

The past wasn’t as good as you remember. The present isn’t as bad as you think. The future will be better than you anticipate.  

过去没有你记得的那么好。现在没有你想的那么糟。未来会比你预期的更好。
