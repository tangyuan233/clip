> Commoncog 专注于加速专业知识获取的方法，主要探讨了三种途径：1) **刻意练习（Deliberate Practice, DP）**，由 K. Anders Ericsson 提出，强调通过特定类型的练习加速技能获取，但设计有效的 DP 练习需要大量时间和资源；2) **自然主义决策方法（Naturalistic Decision Making, NDM）**，通过提取现实世界专家的隐性知识来构建培训方法，适用于无法设计 DP 练习的领域； 3) **试错法**，探讨专家如何通过反复试验和错误积累经验，尤其是在没有现成 DP 练习的领域中。Commoncog 还强调，研究结果的应用需要结合具体背景，并通过实践验证其有效性。文章还推荐了相关书籍和实验，如《Peak》和柔道加速实验，帮助读者更好地理解这些方法。

## What actually works to accelerate expertise acquisition?  
实际上，什么方法能有效加速专业技能的获取？

Let’s say that you want to get good. Let’s say that you want to get good fast. And suppose you’re aiming to be top of your field. How do you go about doing it?  
假设你想变得优秀。假设你想快速变得优秀。再假设你的目标是成为所在领域的顶尖人物。你该如何着手实现这一目标呢？

The typical answer you’ll get is probably something along the lines of ‘go do deliberate practice’, or ‘learn to interleave learning’ or ‘go do spaced repetition’. These answers draw from a rich body of research on practice methods, expertise, and expertise acceleration.  
你可能会得到的典型答案大概是“去做刻意练习”、“学会交叉学习”或“去做间隔重复”之类的话。这些答案借鉴了大量关于练习方法、专业技能和技能加速的研究成果。

That’s the good news.   这就是好消息。

The bad news? The pop versions of these ideas often don’t work that well.  
坏消息是？这些想法的流行版本通常效果不佳。

1. You need to pay careful attention to what the research *actually* says — and what contexts they come from — before you can apply it.  
在应用研究结果之前，你需要仔细关注研究实际所说的内容——以及它们来自哪些背景。
2. Or you need to try these ideas out in practice, and report back on what works.  
或者你需要将这些想法付诸实践，并反馈哪些方法有效。

Those last two bits is Commoncog’s approach.  
最后这两点是 Commoncog 的方法。

“It's rare to find someone that approaches a topic with real nuance. I was a psych major and am still a psych nerd, and the way Cedric writes about expertise and learning is so much truer to the research than anyone else.”  
“很难找到有人能以真正的细微差别来探讨一个话题。我曾是心理学专业的学生，现在仍然是个心理学爱好者，而 Cedric 关于专业知识和学习的写作方式比任何人都更贴近研究。” — [Benyamin Elias, Director of Growth Marketing, Podia](https://twitter.com/BenyaminElias/status/1507038558628069376)

There are, broadly speaking, three approaches to accelerating expertise that Commoncog is interested in.  
Commoncog 感兴趣的加速专业知识的方法大致有三种。

1. **The Deliberate Practice tradition**. This body of work was started by K. Anders Ericsson in the 90s, and broadly discusses practice approaches that accelerate skill acquisition. Ericsson’s work is primarily concerned with something called ‘Deliberate Practice’ (DP). Deliberate Practice is a technical term, it *does not mean ‘practicing deliberately’*. It is a specific type of practice with a specific set of properties. DP is still considered the gold standard today — it is the best, most studied form of practice that produces the best results in certain fields. (Notice the implication: there are lousier forms of practice that are not as good as DP, and there are fields where the best performers do not become good through DP). The main problem with DP is that *coming up* with DP exercises is not free — *someone* has to spend time developing effective DP exercises for your skill domain.  
刻意练习传统。这一系列研究由 K.安德斯·埃里克森在 90 年代发起，广泛讨论了加速技能获取的练习方法。埃里克森的工作主要关注一种称为“刻意练习”（Deliberate Practice，简称 DP）的概念。刻意练习是一个技术术语，它并不意味着“有意识地练习”。它是一种具有特定属性的特殊练习类型。至今，DP 仍被视为黄金标准——在某些领域中，它是经过最多研究、能产生最佳效果的练习形式。（注意其中的含义：存在不如 DP 有效的练习形式，也存在一些领域，其中的顶尖表现者并非通过 DP 变得优秀。）DP 的主要问题在于，设计 DP 练习并非易事——需要有人投入时间为你的技能领域开发有效的 DP 练习。
2. **The Naturalistic Decision Making approach**. What happens when you don’t want to spend time coming up with effective DP exercises? The answer is: you cheat. You find a bunch of real world experts, extract the tacit expertise from their heads, and then build training methods around what they’ve already figured out in their field of work. This body of work is best typified by the work of the Naturalistic Decision Making community (or NDM) — a sub-branch of psychology that has developed methods for studying expertise in real world environments. This topic covers expertise *extraction* methods, theories of expertise in real world environments, and training methods that leverage extracted tacit mental models of expertise.  
自然主义决策方法。当你不想花时间想出有效的动态规划练习时，答案是什么？答案是：你作弊。你找一群现实世界的专家，从他们的头脑中提取隐性专业知识，然后围绕他们在工作领域中已经摸索出的内容构建培训方法。这一工作领域最能体现自然主义决策社区（NDM）的工作——心理学的一个分支，它开发了研究现实环境中专业知识的方法。本主题涵盖专业知识提取方法、现实环境中专业知识的理论，以及利用提取的隐性心智模型进行培训的方法。
3. **The Trial and Error approach**. The above two research approaches beg one other question: *how did these experts become experts in the first place?* DP experts become experts because prior generations of practitioners took the time to develop DP exercises that may accelerate skill development. How did those first experts become good? Similarly, NDM researchers seek out *existing* experts in real world domains — often with no history of DP-style exercises — and then explicate their tacit expertise. How do those experts acquire their expertise in the first place? The answer here is, broadly: they learn through trial and error. But then what separates the masters from the merely good practitioners? This third topic of expertise is perhaps the smallest and the least developed, but no less interesting because many of us operate in domains where we have to get good through time consuming trial and error.  
试错法。上述两种研究方法引出了另一个问题：这些专家最初是如何成为专家的？DP 专家之所以成为专家，是因为前几代的从业者花时间开发了可能加速技能发展的 DP 练习。那些最初的专家是如何变得优秀的？同样，NDM 研究人员在现实世界领域中寻找现有的专家——通常没有 DP 式练习的历史——然后阐明他们的隐性专业知识。这些专家最初是如何获得他们的专业知识的？这里的答案大致是：他们通过试错来学习。但是，是什么将大师与仅仅是优秀的从业者区分开来呢？这第三个关于专业知识的话题可能是最小且最不发达的，但同样有趣，因为我们中的许多人在必须通过耗时的试错来变得优秀的领域中工作。

Why these categories?  为什么是这些类别？

If you spend enough time reading the research, you’d realise that Commoncog’s chosen categories are porous and do not best capture the various research communities operating in the space. And you’d be right! Some DP researchers operate in the ‘expertise extraction’ category; others who work on ‘expertise extraction’ also do work in classroom and traditional DP-style research labs.  
如果你花足够的时间阅读研究，你会意识到 Commoncog 选择的类别是模糊的，并不能最好地捕捉到在该领域运作的各种研究群体。你是对的！一些 DP 研究人员在“专业知识提取”类别中工作；其他从事“专业知识提取”工作的人也在课堂和传统 DP 风格的研究实验室中工作。

In truth there are a number of other ways you could categorise the approaches to accelerating expertise. For instance:  
事实上，还有其他多种方法可以对加速专业知识的途径进行分类。例如：

- You could draw on education research — that is, work focused on improving learning outcomes in *classroom environments*. This is the learning science or educational science side of things — something that overlaps a *little* with expertise research. Commoncog is not explicitly interested in this work, mostly because such research tends to work within the boundaries of teacher-student classroom and school contexts. That isn’t to say that nothing useful may come out of it ([Cognitive Flexibility Theory](https://commoncog.com/learning-ill-structured-domains-series/), for instance, is an example of a real world learning theory that was verified in classroom contexts), just that Commoncog’s interest is limited because we are concerned with expertise in real world environments. After all: most of us *do not learn in classrooms* when it comes to our careers! If you want good coverage of accelerating learning in classroom contexts, we recommend Scott Young’s [Ultralearning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/?ref=commoncog.com).  
你可以借鉴教育研究——即专注于提高课堂环境中学习成果的工作。这是学习科学或教育科学的一面——与专长研究有些重叠。Commoncog 对此并不特别感兴趣，主要是因为这类研究往往局限于师生课堂和学校环境。这并不是说它不会产生有用的成果（例如，认知灵活性理论就是一个在课堂环境中验证的现实世界学习理论的例子），只是 Commoncog 的兴趣有限，因为我们关注的是现实环境中的专长。毕竟：在职业生涯中，我们大多数人并不在课堂上学习！如果你想了解如何在课堂环境中加速学习，我们推荐 Scott Young 的《超学习》。
- We could also differentiate between expertise research studies done in controlled lab environments, versus expertise research done in messy real world environments. Studies in the former category tend to be more difficult to transfer to real world contexts, whilst studies in the latter category tend to have too many confounding variables, and cannot offer clean insights. But Commoncog’s interest is in *what is useful* — which means that it draws from both approaches, filtering according to *whatever works.*  
我们也可以区分在受控实验室环境中进行的专业知识研究，与在混乱的现实世界环境中进行的专业知识研究。前一类研究往往更难转移到现实世界的情境中，而后一类研究则往往存在太多混杂变量，无法提供清晰的见解。但 Commoncog 的兴趣在于实用性——这意味着它从两种方法中汲取经验，根据实际效果进行筛选。

There are many approaches to covering the topic of expertise acceleration. These three are ours.  
关于加速专业知识积累的方法有很多，以下三种是我们的选择。

Here are a couple of tentpole pieces that cover each of the major categories:  
以下是涵盖各大类别的几项核心内容：

## Deliberate Practice  刻意练习

The following are highlights on Commoncog’s coverage of DP:  
以下是 Commoncog 对 DP 报道的亮点：

- You’ll want to start with a [summary of K. Anders Ericsson’s *Peak*](https://commoncog.com/peak-book-summary/), followed by [The Problems with Deliberate Practice](https://commoncog.com/the-problems-with-deliberate-practice/).  
你将首先概述 K.安德斯·埃里克森的《巅峰》，接着是《刻意练习的问题》。
- In late 2022/early 2023 I relocated to a different city and undertook a four month accelerated expertise experiment in Judo to experience DP for myself. You may read the setup for that experiment in [An Expertise Acceleration in Judo](https://commoncog.com/expertise-acceleration-experiment-judo/) and the outcome of that experiment in [Mental Strength in Judo, Mental Strength in Life](https://commoncog.com/mental-strength-judo-life/).  
2022 年末/2023 年初，我搬到了另一个城市，并进行了为期四个月的柔道加速专业实验，以亲身体验 DP。你可以在《柔道中的专业加速》中阅读该实验的设置，并在《柔道中的心理强度，生活中的心理强度》中了解该实验的结果。
- The biggest criticism I had of DP was that *someone* needed to come up with DP exercises in order for DP to work. As a result of my four month Judo experiment, I now have direct experience of what that *actually* looks like. I document this in [Creating New Drills for Deliberate Practice](https://commoncog.com/creating-drills-deliberate-practice/) *(members only)*.  
我对刻意练习（DP）最大的批评是，为了让刻意练习有效，必须有人设计出相应的练习。通过四个月的柔道实验，我现在对实际情况有了直接的体验。我在《为刻意练习设计新训练》（仅限会员）中记录了这一点。

## Naturalistic Decision Making  
自然决策制定

There are more articles on tacit expertise in Commoncog’s archives. Here are some highlights:  
Commoncog 的档案中有更多关于隐性知识的文章。以下是一些亮点：

- The big tentpole series here is the [Tacit Knowledge Series](https://commoncog.com/the-tacit-knowledge-series/) — which lays out how expertise is tacit, why the research around extracting tacit expertise is more important than the literature on deliberate practice (at least, for the business/career practitioner!), and how to go about acquiring tacit knowledge in the pursuit of skill acquisition.  
这里的重磅系列是《隐性知识系列》——它阐述了专业知识为何是隐性的，为何围绕提取隐性知识的研究比刻意练习的文献更为重要（至少对商业/职业从业者而言！），以及如何在追求技能习得的过程中获取隐性知识。
- [Accelerated Expertise](https://commoncog.com/accelerated-expertise/) is a summary of the best book on NDM training methods currently available.  
《加速专长》是目前关于 NDM 训练方法的最佳书籍的总结。
- Cognitive Flexibility Theory is a theory of expertise in ill structured domains — domains like business, investing and medicine. The [Learning in Ill-Structured Domains Series](https://commoncog.com/learning-ill-structured-domains-series/) covers the implications of accelerating expertise in such messy domains.  
认知灵活性理论是一种关于非结构化领域（如商业、投资和医学）中专业知识的理论。《非结构化领域学习系列》探讨了在这些复杂领域中加速专业知识发展的影响。
- [The Most Useful Question to Ask About Expertise](https://commoncog.com/most-useful-question-expertise/) (members only) discusses the expert/novice research paradigm, and walks you through a real world example that you can use in your life.  
关于专业知识最有用的提问（仅限会员）讨论了专家/新手研究范式，并引导您通过一个现实世界的例子，您可以在生活中使用。

## Learning from Trial and Error  
从试错中学习

How do you learn *better* from trial and error?  
如何通过试错更好地学习？

- The big idea here is Cognitive Transformation Theory, which we cover in The [Hard Thing About Learning from Experience](https://commoncog.com/the-hard-thing-about-learning-from-experience/). There are two subtle ideas in the theory: first, experts are more willing to destroy old mental models as they advance; intermediate practitioners are not. Second, this becomes more difficult *the higher up they are in their respective skill trees*.  
这里的核心理念是认知转换理论，我们在《从经验中学习的难点》一书中对此进行了探讨。该理论包含两个微妙观点：首先，专家在进步过程中更愿意摧毁旧有的心智模型；而中级实践者则不然。其次，随着他们在各自技能树上的位置越高，这一过程变得愈加困难。
- [Don’t Read History for Lessons](https://commoncog.com/dont-read-history-for-lessons/) covers some of the difficulty of learning from path-dependent and context-dependent historical events.  
《不要为了教训而读历史》探讨了从路径依赖和情境依赖的历史事件中学习的某些困难。
- [Ability to See Expertise is a Milestone Worth Aiming For](https://commoncog.com/seeing-expertise-milestone-worth-aiming-for/) covers the difficulty of acquiring expertise when you can’t even see expertise.  
看到专业能力是一个值得追求的目标，涵盖了当你甚至看不到专业能力时获取专业知识的难度。

## Wrapping Up  总结

Read on for a full list of expertise coverage. Not every article falls into the three categories above, but this overview captures much of Commoncog’s approach.  
阅读完整列表以了解专业知识覆盖范围。并非每篇文章都归入上述三类，但此概述捕捉了 Commoncog 方法的大部分内容。

## What actually works to accelerate expertise acquisition?

Let’s say that you want to get good. Let’s say that you want to get good fast. And suppose you’re aiming to be top of your field. How do you go about doing it?

The typical answer you’ll get is probably something along the lines of ‘go do deliberate practice’, or ‘learn to interleave learning’ or ‘go do spaced repetition’. These answers draw from a rich body of research on practice methods, expertise, and expertise acceleration.

That’s the good news.

The bad news? The pop versions of these ideas often don’t work that well.

1. You need to pay careful attention to what the research *actually* says — and what contexts they come from — before you can apply it.
2. Or you need to try these ideas out in practice, and report back on what works.

Those last two bits is Commoncog’s approach.
